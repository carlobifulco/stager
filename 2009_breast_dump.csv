It is comprised of a lobulated tumor separated by hyalinized  septa.  The tumor has a heterogeneous appearance and is variably cellular with a prominent myxoid background comprising 40% of the tumor.  The tumor cells have spindle and epithelioid patterns  arranged in areas of variable cellularity from low to high cellularity.  The highly cellular areas are mostly of epithelioid cells with high N:C ratios  hyperchromatic nuclei   inconspicuous nucleoli and prominent atypical mitotic figures.  The cells are arranged in ribbons and sheets and infiltrate into the atrial muscle.  These highly cellular areas alternate with areas of intermediate to low cellularity in which the tumor cells are mostly spindle embedded in a prominent myxoid background with prominent vascularity.  The spindle cells are atypical with easily identifiable abnormal mitoses.  Scattered giant cells and central areas of necrosis are present.  The differential diagnosis includes metastatic spindle cell carcinoma  metastatic spindle cell melanoma  metastatic endometrial stromal sarcoma   leiomyosarcoma  rhabdomyosarcoma  angiosarcoma  liposarcoma  synovial sarcoma  and / myxoid malignant fibrous histiocytoma.A large battery of  immunostains are performed.  Metastatic carcinoma is ruled out with negative epithelial markers of AE1/AE3  cam 5.2 and EMA and breast origin in particular is ruled out with negative staining for BRST-2  ER and PR.   Metastatic melanoma is ruled out with negative S-100  Melan A and HMB45.  Liposarcoma and malignant peripheral nerve sheet tumor (MPNST) are ruled out with the negative S-100.  Angiosarcoma is ruled out with negative CD31 and CD34.   Leiomyosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma are ruled out despite focal staining for SMA but with negative staining for desmin  SMMHC  h-caldesmon and myogenin.   Metastatic endometrial stromal sarcoma (history of TAH/BSO) is ruled out due to negative staining for ER  PR and focal positive staining for CD10.   Synovial sarcoma is ruled out by negative staining for EMA which should be coexpressed with the positive staining for bcl2 and vimentin and negative SYT-SSX  translocation by FISH. Ki-67 nuclear proliferative activity is high approaching 70%.   FISH studies are performed at PhenoPath Laboratories.

Benign intramammary lymph node  see comment.COMMENT:  The core biopsy material demonstrates a nodal structure characterized architecturally by patent sinuses and expanded paracortical areas.  The performed immunohistochemical stains demonstrate the presence of a mixed population of CD3 and CD20 positive B- and T-lymphoid forms showing an appropriate anatomic distribution.  No evidence of aberrant CD5 or BCL-1 expression is identified in the B-cell component.  Immunohistochemical stains for BCL6  and CD10 highlight the presence of small germinal center structures  appropriately negative for BCL-2.  Stains for CD21 and CD23 fail to highlight evidence of an expanded  or significantly distorted dendritic network.  A stain for CD1a highlights the presence of clusters of Langerhans elements in the paracortical nodal areas.  In summary  these morphological and immunohistochemical findings are most consistent with a reactive lymphoid nodal structure and fail to demonstrate diagnostic evidence of involvement by lymphoma or carcinoma.

However  it has been noted that in the majority of these cases a myoepithelial cell layer is not identified by immunohistochemistry  as in this case. One possible explanation for this observation is that these are in situ lesions in which the delimiting myoepithelial cell layer has become markedly attenuated  or it may be that at least some lesions actually represent circumscribed  encapsulated nodules of invasive papillary carcinoma. However  it is thought that regardless of whether these lesions are in situ or invasive carcinomas  available outcome data indicate that they seem to have an excellent prognosis  and that it is most prudent to continue to manage patients with these lesions as they are currently managed  similar to patients with DCIS  and to avoid categorization of such lesions as frankly invasive papillary carcinomas.

Invasive apocrine carcinoma  most consistent with apocrine carcinoma of the skin  see comment.2.  All surgical margins are negative for malignancy.COMMENT:  The excision demonstrates the presence of an invasive adenocarcinoma inserted in the subcutaneous fat and associated with a scar  but does not show evidence of a relationship with any mammary ductal structures  with the latter not actually identifiable in the submitted specimen. All resection margins are negative  with the tumor extending to approximately 7 mm from the closest margin (anterior  slide A10).The performed immunohistochemical stains demonstrate that the neoplastic elements are positive for cytokeratin 7  ER  PR  BRST-2  and show focal minimal immunopositivity for mammoglobulin. Stains for p63  cdx-2  cytokeratin 5/6  TTF-1  PSA  HER2 and cytokeratin 20 are negative. A FISH study for HER2 is also negative.  In summary  these findings raise a differential which includes the possibility of an apocrine carcinoma of the skin or of mammary ductal carcinoma.  Although the phenotype appears to be suggestive of the latter  the absence of an association of the lesion with underlying breast ducts or glands appears to be more in keeping with the possibility of an apocrine carcinoma of the skin.  Case seen in consultation with Dr. James Durham  who concurs with this interpretation.B)  LYMPH NODE  LEFT SENTINEL  BIOPSY:1.

Comment:  Immunohistochemically  there is variable positivity for e-cadherin and CK903  with some areas showing the classic phenotype of lobular intraepithelial neoplasia (LIN/LCIS) with negative e-cadherin staining and positive CK903  while other areas  particularly those present at the margins  show a mixed staining pattern with cells showing positive staining for both markers. In situ lesions exhibiting indeterminate morphologic and immunohistochemial profile are difficult to classify into ductal or lobular types  and some authors have recommended to designate these lesions as having both ductal and lobular differentiation. For management purposes  since e-cadherin is positive  it would be best to consider this lesion at the margins as ductal type and a re-excision is recommended. A precise size/extent is difficult to asses given the mixture of areas of classic LCIS and areas of in situ carcinoma with ductal and lobular features. Scattered foci of in situ carcinoma measuring in the range of 0.1 cm to 0.4 cm are present as discontinuous foci in sections from the superior to the inferior aspect of the specimen (the specimen measured 6 cm from superior to inferior).

Perivascular and interstitial lymphoplasmacytic infiltration with associated lymphoplasmacytic infiltration at the junction of reticular dermis and subcutaneous tissue  negative for carcinoma of any type.COMMENT:  The lymphocytic infitration pattern is extensive.  The histological differential could include an early active inflammatory phase of morphea  inflammatory changes secondary to radiation  a drug reaction of one type   or a T-cell lyphoproliferative disorder. PCR findings are consistent with the presence of a monoclonal T-cell population within this infiltrate. Positive results for T-cell clonality alone are not specific or diagnostic for lymphoma because T-cell clonality can be seen in other conditions such as T-lymphocytosis or benign T-cell proliferations as in viral infections and sometimes associated with CTD  etc. We do not favor a lymphoma on the basis of the histology of this infiltrate within the skin and subcutaneous tissue. However  that possibility is difficult to rule out with absolute certainty. If the patient develops a lesion (s) at any other site  then repeat diagnostic biopsy   gene rearrangement studies and comparison of subsequent findings with this biopsy would be prudent. The case has been seen in consultation by Dr Yaping Wu  Board Certified in Hematopathology  who concurs with the above diagnosis and discussion.Interpreted by James B.

These are included on a set of two blocks.  The H&E stained sections demonstrate very sclerotic fibrous tissue and on slide A2 an obliterated vein is noted.  This densely collagenous tissue includes a scattered cellular infiltrate that includes aggregates of lymphocytes  but no definite lymphomatous infiltrate is identified  nor is there evidence of metastatic carcinoma  particularly metastatic breast carcinoma.  Included with the specimen are several cores of skeletal muscle  some of which show a focal lymphoid infiltrate.Block A1 is evaluated with a large panel of monoclonal antibodies.  An immunohistochemical stain for cytokeratin cam 5.2 is negative.  CD20  which is a B-cell marker  shows only a few B-cells  and these are most commonly identified in the skeletal muscle.  The T-cell marker CD3 shows more T-cells than the skeletal muscle and scattered T-cells in the densely sclerotic fibrous tissue.  The classical Hodgkin lymphoma markers CD30 and CD15 are both negative  as are stains for CD34 and bcl-2  which can mark a solitary fibrous tumor.  The capillary endothelium stains positively with CD34.An immunostain for S-100 protein is negative.  A stain for desmin highlights the skeletal muscle as anticipated  but the sclerotic fibrous tissue is silent with this reagent.  One of the sclerotic cores on A1 stains strongly with smooth muscle actin  while the second shows focal staining.  The focus that stains strongly for smooth muscle actin stains with CD99.  The plasma cell marker CD138 fails to demonstrate a significant plasma cell component.  The proliferation rate with mib-1 is very low.  An elastic stain on slide A2 confirms an obliterated vein.

Of note  the residual hematopoietic elements are estimated to account for only approximately 5% of the submitted biopsy and show focal evidence of a preserved trilineage hematopoiesis.The performed immunohistochemical stains demonstrate that the neoplastic elements are positive for cam 5.2  AE1/AE3  CK7  ER  PR and mammoglobin while negative for TTF-1  WT-1 and CK20.In summary  these morphological and immunohistochemical findings are consistent with involvement by a metastatic carcinoma  and although not entirely specific  favor the possibility of a breast primary.

COMMENT:  The tumor bed is characterized by variable cellularity of residual invasive ductal carcinoma with areas characterized by a fibroelastotic stroma with minimal residual scattered neoplastic cells while in other areas  there is high cellularity of invasive carcinoma.  In addition  there is high grade DCIS associated with invasive carcinoma.  The decrease in cellularity after therapy is estimated between 30-90% (estimated 40-50%).  Using the Miller-Payne system for grading response to treatment would correspond to a grade 3 out of 5 (5 being a complete pathologic response).  Sections from the lymph nodes show no evidence of metastatic carcinoma and no evidence of fibrotic changes that could suggest previous involvement by carcinoma.

Foci of low grade DCIS as well as ADH are identified on this prior needle core biopsy specimen. This needle core biopsy is indicated to be from the lower central region of the left breast per the Diagnostic Imaging Breast Biopsy Pathology Request Form which was submitted with the needle core biopsy specimen. In the current modified radical mastectomy specimen  small cribriforming foci are present which have low grade cytologic features and measure less than 2 mm in a given focus; based on these findings  these foci in the mastectomy specimen are interpreted to represent additional foci of ADH  similar to those seen in the needle core biopsy. Changes consistent with a prior biopsy site are identified associated with the grossly described fibrous tissue region in the lower-inner quadrant of the mastectomy specimen. The entire gross region of fibrous tissue involving the lower-outer and lower-inner quadrants of the mastectomy specimen is submitted for histologic examination. Changes diagnostic of DCIS are not identified in any of the mastectomy sections. No invasive malignancy is identified in either the needle core biopsy or the mastectomy specimen.  As per protocol  a second lymph node dissection is performed following DissectAid treatment of the axillary contents.  No additional lymph nodes are identified following this second lymph node search.Pathology Staging Summary*Specimen type:  Needle core biopsy (SP-09-23029) and subsequent modified radical mastectomy (SP-09-26070)*Specimen size (for specimens less than total mastectomy):  N/A*Tumor size:  Discrete tumor mass not identified grossly*Laterality (right versus left):  Left*Tumor type(s) present:  Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)*Size of invasive component:  N/A*Histologic grade:  N/A*Nuclear grade:  N/AGrade of DCIS:  Low-gradeDCIS component of invasive carcinoma (extensive vs not extensive):  N/ACalcification: Within benign component:  Yes  Within in situ component:  Yes Within invasive component:  N/AVascular invasion:  Not identified*Tumor site (UOQ  UIQ  LOQ  LIQ  central  unknown):  Lower central (per Diagnostic Imaging Breast Biopsy Pathology Request Form on needle core biopsy)Tumor multicentricity:  NoTumor multifocality:  No*Nipple:  Negative for malignancy*Skin:  Negative for malignancy*Surgical margins (distance from closest margin must be stated for both invasive and DCIS components):  DCIS greater than 1 cm removed from all surgical marginsLymph nodes:*Lymph node sampling: Axillary dissection*Lymph node status is as follows: *Number of metastatic nodes/total number of nodes examined:  0/4 *Extension beyond nodal capsule:  N/A *Nodes fixed to one another or to other structures:  N/AVan Nuys Prognostic Index Size:  1 Margins:  1 Grade:  1 Total score:  3*TNM stage:  pTis  pN0(i-)  MXSpecial studies: ER/PR hormone receptors:  Strongly positive/strongly positive Block:  A1 (SP-09-23029)

This report references a Legacy Diagnostic Services pathology report (SP-09-5135) which is stated to have diagnosed the breast needle core biopsy as invasive poorly differentiated carcinoma (see comment).  COMMENT:  Immunohistochemical studies including prognostic markers will be performed and the results will be reported in an addendum.  The operative report on the current case from November 30th  2009 is also reviewed.  This reports describes that the patient has received preoperative chemotherapy prior to the lumpectomy procedure.  The left breast mammogram report of November 30th  2009  describes complete resolution of the mammographic mass.  This history of preoperative chemotherapy with radiographic evidence of complete resolution of the mammographic mass would fit with the absence of carcinoma identified in the current lumpectomy specimen.  In this clinical setting  the area of fibrosis with scattered minimal chronic inflammation and hemosiderin-containing macrophages likely represents changes related to the prior chemotherapy treatment. Correlation with the pre-treatment clinical findings and findings in the pre-treatment needle core biopsy and associated prognostic studies performed at the outside institution would be necessary for further evaluation of this process.

COMMENT: The patient's clinical history of left breast cancer in 1990 is noted. In the current case  a tumor mass measuring 2.1 cm was grossly present at the junction of the upper-outer quadrant/axillary tail in the region of the localizing wire. Microscopically  this mass consists of infiltrating ductal carcinoma involving fibroadipose tissue. No lymphoid tissue or residual lymph node architecture is associated with the invasive carcinoma in this region. In addition  four axillary lymph nodes are also present  all of which are involved to a varying extent by metastatic carcinoma. The lymph node containing the largest extent of metastatic carcinoma (1.3 cm greatest dimension) also shows evidence of extranodal tumor extension  with focal involvement of the inked superficial soft tissue margin by extranodal carcinoma. Based on these findings  the carcinoma is classified as a T2  pN2a  MX overall stage.CONSULTATION: Maritza Martel  M.D. (A6  A15-A21  A23-A25) Pathology Staging Summary*Specimen type:  Modified radical mastectomy*Specimen size:  N/A*Tumor size:  2.1 cm*Laterality:  Left*Tumor type(s) present:  Infiltrating ductal carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)*Size of invasive component:  2.1 cm greatest dimension*Histologic grade:  3 of 3 *Nuclear grade:  3 of 3Grade of DCIS:  Intermediate gradeDCIS component of invasive carcinoma:  N/ACalcification: Within benign component:  Yes Within in situ component:  Not identified Within invasive component:  Not identified*Tumor site:  UOQ/axillary tailTumor multicentricity:  NoTumor multifocality:  No*Nipple:  Negative for malignancy*Skin:  Negative for malignancy*Surgical margins:  Invasive carcinoma 4 mm from deep surgical margin and 7 mm from superficial surgical margin in UOQ/axillary tail mass region; extranodal metastatic carcinoma focally involves superfical soft tissue margin*Lymph node sampling: Axillary dissection*Lymph node status is as follows: *Number of metastatic nodes/total number of nodes examined:  4/4  *Extension beyond nodal capsule:  Yes *Nodes fixed to one another or to other structures:  Not identified*TNM stage:  pT2  pN2a  MX (see comment)Special studies: ER/PR hormone receptors:  Positive (100%)/positive (variable -    approximately 30% overall) Nuclear proliferation index (mib-1): High (greater than 20%) Block:  A18Left breast modified radical mastectomy:  Invasive ductal carcinoma  negative for amplification of HER-2/neu gene by FISH study.

The flow cytometry analysis reveals a kappa monotypic B cell population expressing CD19 and CD20  but not CD5 and CD10  supporting the diagnosis (see flow cytometry FP-09-936).3.  Immunohistochemical studies show the lymphoma cells to be positive for CD20  PAX-5  bcl-6 and MUM-1  but negative for CD10  bcl-2 and Cyclin-D1 (see comment).  4.  No evidence of breast atypical epithelial hyperplasia  in situ or invasive carcinoma of is identified.  COMMENT:  The expression of bcl-6 and MUM-1  and the lack of expression of CD10 indicate diffuse large B cell lymphoma of non-germinal center cell or active B cell origin  which may predict a more aggressive clinical course.  However  clinical correlation is necessary for complete interpretation.

COMMENT:  In the Part B specimen  the larger lymph node contains micrometastatic carcinoma.  The largest dimension of micrometastatic carcinoma in this larger lymph node spans 1.4 mm.  Collections of keration positive isolated tumor cells are seen elsewhere in this larger lymph node.  Keratin positive isolated tumor cells are also seen in the smaller lymph node.  Based on these findings  this is interpreted to represent micrometastatic carcinoma involving one of two lymph nodes.  In the part C specimen  nine additional lymph nodes are present  all of which are negative for malignancy on H&E and keratin immunohistochemical stains.  By convention  the overall lymph node status is classified as micrometastatic carcinoma involving one of eleven lymph nodes  and the overall lymph node stage is classified as pN1mi.

In this area  a central tract is present which is surrounded by fibrosis  fat necrosis and patchy mild chronic inflammation.  Fibrosis adjacent to this needle core biopsy tract is also seen in the central section from gross slice 10 (slide A4) as well as gross slice 8 (slide A10).  Adjacent to the region of fibrosis associated with the prior needle core biopsy tract in slide A10 can be seen a focus of atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH).  This focus of ADH measures 1.2 mm in greatest dimension microscopically.  In this focus  a mild proliferation of ductal epithelial cells is present which have small  rather uniform nuclei with more regular luminal space formation.  Adjacent ductules in this focus show mild ductal hyperplasia without atypia as well as fibrocystic changes with cystic dilatation and apocrine metaplasia.  Immunohistochemical stain for cytokeratin 5/6 performed on block A10 shows lack of staining in the epithelial cells in the atypical focus  supporting the H&E impression of ADH. The focus of ADH in slide A10 is 7 mm from the posterior surgical margin and greater than 1 cm removed from the lateral  medial  superior  inferior and anterior surgical margins. Keratin AE1/AE3 immunohistochemical stains performed on blocks A4 and A7 show no evidence of invasive carcinoma in the prior needle core biopsy site region.  The remainder of the breast tissue shows predominantly mature adipose tissue with less prominent fibrous stromal regions.  Within the fibrous stroma can be seen benign breast ductules arranged in lobular architecture as well as occasional larger ducts.  Fibrocystic changes are present with cystic dilatation of benign ductules and involvement by apocrine metaplasia.  Focal ductal hyperplasia is present  which is up to moderate  without atypia.  Immunohistochemical stain for cytokeratin 5/6 performed on block A2 shows positive staining in the epithelial cells  supporting the H&E impression of ductal hyperplasia without atypia in this focus.

Microcalcifications are seen associated with these ducts.  On one core fragment  extravasated mucin is present extending to the margin of the core biopsy.  Floating epithelial tufts are also seen in this mucin. The features are consistent with a mucocele like lesion associated with atypical ductal hyperplasia.

Adenocarcinoma (see comment).Comment: The adenocarcinoma is present within the stroma of the cervical biopsy and does not involve the overlying mucosa. The histological pattern is somewhat different than the usual appearing cervical adenocarcinoma. For these reasons a battery of immunohistochemical stains  was obtained with the following results: CK7+ CK20- CDX2- TTF-1- BRST-2- mammaglobin- WT- synaptophysin-CA125+ P16+ vimentin+ ER+ CEA+ and mucicarmine+. This profile is consistent with a primary cervical adenocarcinoma and tends to exclude metastatic lung  breast and GI primaries as well as endometrial carcinoma. Nevertheless  a metastatic lesion cannot be completely excluded.

The necrotic nodular regions in these two lymph nodes likely represent areas of metastatic carcinoma which have become totally necrotic; however  viable metastatic carcinoma is not identified in these two lymph nodes. Regardless of the classification of these two focally necrotic lymph nodes without identifiable viable tumor  the overall node stage would not change and the node stage would be classified as pN2a.Pathology Staging Summary*Specimen type:  Lumpectomy with separate new posterior medial margin*Specimen size (for specimens less than total mastectomy):  11 cm superior to inferior  8 cm anterior to posterior and 5.5 cm medial to lateral (lumpectomy); 7.5 cm superior to inferior  2.3 cm medial to lateral and 0.7 cm anterior to posterior (new posterior medial margin)*Tumor size:  1.1 x 1.1 x 1 cm*Laterality (right versus left):  Right*Tumor type(s) present:  Infiltrating ductal carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ*Size of invasive component:  1.1 cm in greatest dimension*Histologic grade:  3/3*Nuclear grade:  3/3Grade of DCIS:  Intermediate gradeDCIS component of invasive carcinoma (extensive vs not extensive):  Not extensiveVascular invasion:  Lymphovascular tumor involvement identified*Tumor site (UOQ  UIQ  LOQ  LIQ  central  unknown):  UnknownTumor multicentricity:  NoTumor multifocality:  No*Nipple:  N/A*Skin:  Negative for malignancy*Surgical margins (distance from closest margin must be stated for both invasive and DCIS components):  Invasive carcinoma involves the inferior surgical margin  7 mm from posterior surgical margin  and greater than 1 cm removed from superior  anterior  lateral and medial surgical margins; DCIS 5 mm from posterior surgical margin and does not come closer to the remaining surgical margins than that described for the invasive componentLymph nodes:*Lymph node sampling: Axillary dissection*Lymph node status is as follows: *Number of metastatic nodes/total number of nodes examined:  Viable metastatic carcinoma involving six lymph nodes with nodular necrotic foci without identifiable viable neoplastic cells involving two additional lymph nodes (out of thirteen total lymph nodes) [see comment] *Extension beyond nodal capsule:  Not identified *Nodes fixed to one another or to other structures:  Not identified*TNM stage:  T1c pN2a MXSpecial studies:   Estrogen hormone receptors:  Strongly positive Progesterone hormone receptors:  Strongly positive Nuclear proliferation index (mib-1):  High (greater than 50%) HER-2/neu by FISH:  Positive for amplification of HER-2/neu gene; the average score per tumor cell is 8.3 for HER-2/neu probe and 3.45 for CEN-17 probe; the HER-2/neu to CEN-17 ratio is 2.41 Block:  A1 (SP09-20317)

Blocks B1 through B7 showed scant microcalcifications in block B3 associated with fibroadenomatoid changes.  A second round of radiographs attempted on all blocks and showed similar calcifications in block A1 and scant calcifications in block B6.  Multiple deeper sections were obtained from block B6 and failed to show these microcalcifications  which could explained by exhaustion during multiple cuttings.Also  immunohistochemical stains for SMMHC and p63  for a myoepithelial layer  are applied to block B3 and support a benign process.  No malignant process identified; neither in situ nor invasive carcinoma.

Invasive ductal carcinoma  nuclear grade 2  with features suggestive of a micropapillary pattern  see comment.COMMENT:  Sections show the presence of involvement by a ductal carcinoma  nuclear grade 2  spanning at least 6 mm in the cores.  The tumor is characterized by clusters of neoplastic elements failing to show a central lumen  while surrounded by a peripheral space.  These features are suggestive of an invasive carcinoma with a micropapillary pattern  although the possibility of retraction artifact cannot be entirely excluded in this sample.  A stain for EMA is appropriately positive in the neoplastic elements  with focal presence of an inside-out staining pattern.  Definitive evidence of vascular invasion is not identified in a stain for CD34.Case seen in consultation with Dr. Maritza Martel  who concurs with this interpretation.Sections are stained for estrogen and progesterone receptors by an immunohistochemical technique and HER-2/neu by FISH.  The proliferation rate is determined with an immunohistochemical stain for mib-1.  The results are as follows:Estrogen Receptor:  3+  100%Progesterone Receptor:  3+  100%Proliferation Rate (Ki-67):  Intermediate COMMENT:  Performance of the immunologic reagents utilized in the above report have been characterized by Providence Portland Medical Center.

Within the fibrous stroma can be seen breast ductules arranged in lobular architecture.  Some of these ductules show mild ductal hyperplasia without atypia.  This impression is supported by positive staining in the epithelial cells in these regions on immunohistochemical stain for cytokeratin 5/6. Focal ductal hyperplasia with more rigid luminal formation is seen in slide A1.  These cells have small  round nuclei with limited variability in size.  These show lack of staining in the epithelial cells on immunohistochemical stain for cytokeratin 5/6.  Based on the size and histologic features  this is interpreted to represent focal atypical ductal hyperplasia.  Features diagnostic of ductal carcinoma in situ are not identified.  No invasive malignancy is present.

In the keratin stains four out of nine lymph nodes (4/9) showed scattered cells and clusters of keratin positive cells consistent with metastatic lobular carcinoma. Estimating the size of the tumor is difficult in cases of previous biopsies. However  considering the extent of the invasive carcinoma in the previous and current specimens the size is likely to be > 5cm  therefore  staged as T3.

Prior to chemotherapy  the mass in the right breast was clinically evaluated to be approximately 4 cm.  The ill-defined area of fibrosis with patchy mild chronic inflammation and focal hemosiderin deposition in the part D right breast lumpectomy specimen would fit with changes related to effects of this prior chemotherapy.  No residual carcinoma is identified in this region of the part D right breast lumpectomy specimen or in any of the specimens submitted.In the part E right breast new inferior and lateral margin specimen  a small luminal space is present which is lined by histiocytes with surrounding mild fibrosis and focal hemosiderin deposition.  No malignant process is associated with this region.  This may represent changes secondary to a residual prior biopsy tract region or to a ruptured duct.  Clinical correlation would be required in this regard.

COMMENT:  There are many features to suggest that this is a primary carcinoma of the fallopian tube rather than a metastasis from the breast.  The current neoplasm shows positivity for estrogen receptor while the breast carcinoma was found to be negative.  This tumor strongly expresses WT-1 which is typically a marker of serous carcinomas and the current neoplasm is negative for mammaglobin and BRST-2 both markers of breast carcinoma.  The overall morphology also favors a serous carcinoma.  In addition to the major mass in the right tube and adjacent soft tissue  there is a focus of similar carcinoma involving the left fallopian tube.  Whether this is metastasis or synchronous is a moot point.  The very high proliferation rate and extreme expression of p53 along with the highly atypical cytology suggest that this is an aggressive neoplasm.Pathology Staging SummaryMACROSCOPIC:Specimen type:  Hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomyPrimary Tumor Site:  Right fallopian tubeRelationship to ovary:  FusedStatus of fimbriated end:  ClosedSpecimen Integrity:  Side:  Right - rupturedTumor location:  Fimbriae; ampullaTumor size:  Greatest dimension - 5 x 3.5 x 2.5 cmHistologic type:  Papillary and solid serous carcinoma  poorly differentiatedHistologic grade:  G3Peritoneal Washings:  NP09-1936 - negative for malignant cellsPathologic Staging:  pT1c (tumor limited to one or both tubes with extension into and through the serosa or with malignant cells in ascites or peritoneal washing) pNXStage:  FIGO Stage 1C

Negative for invasive carcinoma.COMMENT:  The performed immunohistochemical stains demonstrated the aberrant expression of cytokeratin 5/6 and cytokeratin 903 in the DCIS component  findings consistent with the above interpretation.  Stains for SMMHC and P63 highlight the presence of a cluster of epithelial elements lacking a defined myoepithelial layer and localized in close association with the previous biopsy site  histologically most consistent with displaced epithelial cells.Case seen in consultation with Dr. Maritza Martel  who concurs with this interpretation.

Four additional cyto-spin preparations are subsequently prepared  two for special stains.  In the Pap and Wright-Giemsa stained cyto-spin preparations  the cellularity is relatively high.  Many of the cells have somewhat monotonous nuclei and variable amounts of surrounding cytoplasm that is sometimes scant.  Some of the nuclei  however  are irregular with prominent nucleoli.  These are sometimes clustered and sometimes present singly.  In one small cluster  there is a suggestion of a possible mitotic figure.  One of the cyto-spin preparations is stained by the immunoperoxidase method with antibodies to cytokeratin and shows positivity in the atypical cells noted.  A vimentin immunostain is performed on another cyto-spin preparation and it is essentially negative in the atypical cells.  Collectively  the morphologic and immunophenotypic features are consistent with malignancy and could be compatible with this patient's history of metastatic breast carcinoma.  (jls)

Metastatic adenocarcinoma with intestinal-like histologic features (see microscopic description and comment).COMMENT: The metastatic adenocarcinoma in this case has intestinal-like features with cytoplasmic goblet cell appearance in some areas. Strongly positive CK7 staining with weaker CK20 staining can be seen in adenocarcinomas of the upper gastrointestinal tract and this pattern would argue against a colonic primary source; however  appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinomas can show a higher proportion of CK7 positivity and less prominent CK20 staining and these tumors tend to show a brush border pattern on villin stain  as was seen here. Strongly positive CDX2 staining is also typical with gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas. Upper GI sources to rule out would include esophagus and stomach; pancreatic adenocarcinomas usually show cytoplasmic staining with villin  rather than the brush border pattern seen here  and the pancreas is described as normal on the patient's recent abdominal CT report of 9/20/2009. This histologic pattern and CK7/CK20 profile can also be seen in mucinous carcinomas of ovarian origin. Positive CDX2 staining can also be seen with mucinous ovarian carcinomas. However  ovarian mucinous carcinomas tend to show cytoplasmic staining without brush border reactivity with villin. Also  no ovarian masses are described in the recent pelvic CT report of 9/20/2009. This CK7/CK20 pattern can also be seen in carcinomas of breast ductal origin; however  this intestinal-like morphology would be unusual for a breast carcinoma and the absence of staining for estrogen receptor  BRST-2 and mammaglobin do not lend support for a breast primary. Given the presence of a large mass in the right lung with invasion into the hilum and mediastinum described on the chest CT of 9/20/2009  an enteric (intestinal-like) adenocarcinoma of primary lung origin would be in the differential  as these can show a CK7 positive/ CK20 positive profile with positive CDX2 staining and can closely imitate gastrointestinal primary adenocarcinomas in metastatic sites.In summary  in this metastatic adenocarcinoma with intestinal-like histologic features  primary origin from upper gastrointestinal sources such as esophagus and stomach would need to be ruled out on a clinincal basis. A pancreatic primary source appears unlikely based on the negative radiologic imaging impression. An appendical primary source would need to be excluded on a clinical basis but primary sources from elsewhere in the colon have been ruled out based on these findings. A mucinous ovarian primary source appears unlikely based on the findings here as well as on the negative radiologic imaging impression. An enteric (intestinal-like) adenocarcinoma of primary lung origin is in the differential based on the pathologic findings and the presence of a large lung mass; however  the other gastrointestinal primary sources listed above must first be excluded clinically.

Radiographic examination of the paraffin embedded tissue blocks reveals some residual microcalcifications in block A1  which when sectioned at seven additional levels through the block are represented by a small cluster of microcalcifications and some additional randomly distributed microcalcifications in the areas of adenosis.  The ductal epithelium in the areas of adenosis shows positive immunostaining for E-cadherin antigen and is encompassed by myoepithelium exhibiting positive immunostaining for smooth muscle myosin heavy chain antigen  which effectively rules out infiltrating lobular carcinoma.  The cells are also positive for epithelial membrane antigen and ER/PR antigens which are characteristically absent in microglandular adenosis.  No atypical ductal hyperplasia  carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma is identified.

Some of the minute ductal structures that can be identified in the immunostained sections do not show a definitive myoepithelial cell layer  therefore  although these areas are very small for a definitive interpretation  the findings are suspicious for an invasive carcinoma.

Fragment of radial scar with sclerosing adenosis and atypical apocrine metaplasia2. Microcalcifications are present and are identified in association with the foci of sclerosing adenosis.COMMENT:  The biopsy shows the presence of a sclerosing lesion consisting of a radial scar with areas of sclerosing adenosis  the latter involved by foci of atypical apocrine metaplasia.  Microcalcifications are identified in association with the sclerosing adenosis.  Features diagnostic of in situ or invasive carcinoma are not present.  The performed immunohistochemical stains demonstrate the presence of a preserved myoepithelial layer (SMMHC)  partially positive for P63.  A stain for CK903 is appropriately positive in the epithelial elements  which appear also to be decorated by a stain for E-cadherin.  Note is made of lack of CK5/6 staining in the epithelial component  a finding compatible with the presence of apocrine differentiation. In summary  the biopsy shows a radial scar with areas of sclerosing adenosis and foci of atypical apocrine metaplasia. An excisional biopsy is recommended. Case seen in consultation with Dr. Maritza Martel  who concurs with this interpretation.

Sections from  a biopsy site identified in the upper outer quadrant approximately at 2:00 show invasive carcinoma associated with the previous biopsy site.  Per outside pathology report  two previous sites were biopsied (Legacy Laboratory Services  SP-09-8333) at 2:00 showing microscopic foci of infiltrating ductal carcinoma and LCIS and a second site at 3:00 showing infiltrating ductal carcinoma  grade 1  and lobular carcinoma in situ  and an e-cadherin immunostain performed at the outside institution is reported as positive.  E-cadherin immunostain performed on the invasive carcinoma in the current mastectomy specimen shows only minimal weak staining in some of the tumor cells.   Based on the overall findings the tumor is considered to have ductal an lobular features with a morphology predominantly of lobular with minimal positivity for e-cadherin.

Of note  the surrounding breast parenchyma appears atrophic  and fails to demonstrate evidence of an atypical epithelial proliferation or of carcinoma. The performed immunohistochemical stains demonstrate the presence of a mixed population of small B- and T-lymphoid cells with reactive germinal centers  appropriately positive for bcl-6 and negative for bcl-2.  A stain for BCL1 fails to demonstrate evidence of aberrant expression in the B-cell population  as does a stain for CD43.  In summary  these findings are most consistent with the presence of a reactive lymphoid process. possibly representng and intramammary lymph node with changes secondary to a previous biopsy site  or alternatively a  prominent lymphoid response at  the site of a previous biopsy.  Findings diagnostic of lymphoma or carcinoma are not identified.

These are characterized by closely approximated ovoid nuclei that have finely stippled chromatin  diffuse hyperchromasia and small nucleoli.  Abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm is present and mitotic figures are identified.  The appearance of the glands is strongly suggestive of a colonic primary.  The neoplasm is evaluated with a panel of monoclonal antibodies.  CD20 positively stains the well preserved neoplastic glands and there is abundant staining in the necrotic neoplasm that dominates the slide.  CDX-2  which is a marker of lower gastrointestinal neoplasms  shows nuclear staining in the neoplastic glands consistent with a colonic primary.  Keratin 7  which is typically positive in pulmonary and breast carcinomas  is negative  including the well preserved neoplastic foci.

Of note  the LCIS component appears to have lost expression of beta-catenin and is appropriately positive for CK903.  A stain for ER is strongly positive in the DCIS component (100%  3+) while a stain for PR appears to be negative.Case seen in consultation with Dr. Maritza Martel  who concurs with this interpretation.

Metastatic carcinoma involving one of four lymph nodes (1/4); metastatic carcinoma measures 8 mm in greatest dimension; extranodal tumor extension not identified.   COMMENT:  Invasive carcinoma is identified which is mainly present adjacent to a prior biopsy tract region. The greatest dimension of the invasive carcinoma adjacent to the biopsy tract region spans 6 mm.  In addition  in slide A7  a component of invasive ductal carcinoma is seen approximately 6 mm from the invasive carcinoma associated with the biopsy tract region in this section.  A small amount of DCIS is present in the tissue intervening between the invasive components but the invasive carcinoma in this region does not appear to be continuous.  Based on these findings  the invasive carcinoma is interpreted to be multifocal  with the invasive foci being close but separate in this region.

High-grade poorly differentiated carcinoma  compatible with a breast primary   see comment.COMMENT:  The biopsy material demonstrates the presence of a poorly differentiated malignant epithelial neoplasm  characterized by a trabecular pattern of growth and composed of elements with prominent nucleoli  pleomorphic nuclei and relatively abundant cytoplasm  associated with dense inflammatory response.  The performed immunohistochemical stains demonstrate that the neoplastic elements are positive for keratin AE1/AE3  CK7  E-cadherin and beta-catenin  while showing only minimal focal positivity for cytokeratin 903.  Stains for CD45  ER  PR  WT-1  CK20  CDX2  TTF1 are negative.  The proliferative index is high  as estimated by a stain for Ki-67 (approximately 85%). In summary  these morphological and immunophenotypic findings  although non-specific  are compatible with a poorly differentiated breast primary high grade ductal carcinoma (nuclear grade 3  architectural grade 3). Correlation with the clinical findings is however recommended. Case seen in consultation with Dr. Frank Curl  who concurs with this interpretation.

Poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma  phenotypically most consistent with squamous cell carcinoma (see comment).COMMENT:  Sections demonstrate five small cores of neoplastic tissue showing sheets and nests of highly atypical neoplastic cells with large  ovoid nuclear contours  hyperchromatin  prominent nucleoli  active mitoses and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No evidence of keratinization  ductal formation or glandular formation is identified.  The subsequent immunostains show the neoplastic cells to be strongly positive for keratin AE1/AE3  keratin 5/6 and focally positive for CEA-mono  but negative for keratin 7  keratin 20  TTF-1  ER  BRST-2 and mammoglobin.  The immunostaining profile rules out the possibility of metastatic breast carcinoma  and is most consistent with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of either pulmonary primary or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma from head and neck origin.  Clinical correlation is recommended for complete interpretation.Intradepartmental consultation was performed by Dr. Sanaa Hussain  Pulmonary Pathologist  who concurs with the diagnosis.

Fibrocystic changes with microcalcifications.2.  Small intraductal papilloma (see comment).3.  Usual ductal hyperplasia.4.  No evidence of carcinoma.Comment:  Thank you for allowing us to review this breast biopsy  and we agree with the diagnosis.  There are fibrocystic changes characterized by mildly distended ducts lined by apocrine epithelium containing microcalcifications (calcium oxalate) and areas of usual ductal hyperplasia are also present. In one of the fragments (in slide A2  levels 1 and 2) is a small intraductal papilloma measuring 1.2 mm that appears to be confined to the core and disappears in the deeper levels examined.  The recommendation for excision of intraductal papillomas identified in core biopsies remains controversial.  Most would recommend an excisional biopsy of papillary lesions when the lesion has been incompletely sampled by the core biopsy.  In this case where the biopsy was performed for microcalcifications  and in addition a small intraductal papilloma without evidence of atypia or malignancy is identified  clinical correlation with imaging findings and clinical presentation is recommended to determine the need for an excisional biopsy versus clinical followup.  This case is discussed with Dr. McIvor.

The performed immunohistochemical stains (P63  SMMHC) fail to demonstrate evidence of a loss of the peripheral myoepithelial elements  a finding most consistent with the absence  in this biopsy material  of an invasive component.

These findings are consistent with involvement by an intermediate-grade DCIS.  The performed immunohistochemical stains support this interpretation  showing aberrant loss of expression of CK5/6 and CK903.

Invasive mucinous and ductal carcinoma and in situ ductal carcinoma  see comment and pathology staging summary.COMMENT:  The tumor is multifocal  with three foci of invasive carcinoma measuring 1.7  1.5 and 0.6 cm  respectively  the largest of which appears to be located in the upper-outer quadrant and extends to approximately 2 mm from the closest resection margin (posterior).  Significant changes associated with neoadjuvant therapy are not identifies. The tumor shows predominantly mucinous differentiation (colloid carcinoma)  although there is significant heterogeneity  with one focus showing presence of a predominant conventional ductal carcinoma component (section B12). An additional focus composed entirely of in situ carcinoma is highlighted in section B16. One small node out of nine appears to be positive  for metastatic carcinoma on both H&E and keratin sections.  The involved small nodal structure measures more then 2 mm and is completely replaced by mucinous material with embedded clusters of neoplastic epithelial elements. The tumor's pN is here assigned accordingly to this measurement  although the metastatic tumor clusters per se span for approximately 1.7 mm in greatest dimension.

Definitive lymphovascular invasion not identified.Comment:  A prominent tumor is identified in the left breast and each of the sampled lymph nodes from the left axilla as well as nodes within the mastectomy specimen show extensive involvement by metastatic carcinoma.  Much of the left breast carcinoma shows prominent tubule formation suggestive of ductal differentiation.  However  a significant proportion also shows histologic features more compatible with lobular differenation and an e-cadherin immunostain is negative.  Additionally  one of the six identified lymph nodes from the right breast shows metastatic lobular carcinoma.  A primary tumor within the right breast is not identified after extensive sampling.  The significance of the finding of metastatic carcinoma within the right breast node is unclear as it shows a similar immunophenotype as the left breast carcinoma.  Therefore  the tumor within the right breast node may represent metastasis from an unidentified tumor from the right breast or metastasis from the contralateral left breast tumor.  Clinical correlation is required.  Dr. Maritza Martel has reviewed portions of this case.Sections from the left breast tumor (slide D7) are stained for estrogen and progesterone receptors by an immunohistochemical technique and HER-2/neu by FISH.  The proliferation rate is determined with an immunohistochemical stain for mib-1.

Prominent biopsy site changes.  4.  Fibrocystic changes.5.  Skin with dermal scar and suture material  negative for malignancy.  COMMENT:  The focus of residual infiltrating lobular carcinoma in the current case is compared with the slides of the patient's previous infiltrating lobular carcinoma of the left breast (SP-09-13881).  The invasive carcinoma has a similar appearance in both specimens.  The focus of residual invasive carcinoma in the current case is present in the section containing the superior half of gross slice ten of eleven  proceeding from medial to lateral. The relationship of the focus of residual invasive carcinoma to the anterior  posterior  inferior and superior margins can be determined directly from measurements from slides A19 and A20. Residual invasive carcinoma is not identified in the sections containing the lateral and medial margin tissue; however  the invasive carcinoma is present in the tenth of eleven gross slices proceeding from medial to lateral.  Based on the gross thickness of approximately 4 mm for each gross slice  the invasive carcinoma is estimated to be at least 4 mm (but not more than 8 mm) from the lateral surgical margin and greater than 1 cm removed from the medial surgical margin based on this gross specimen correlation.  The remainder of the staging summary information for this tumor can be obtained from the patient's prior left breast lumpectomy specimen (SP-09-13881).

They appear to be associated with changes compatible with previous biopsy site.  Although the assessment of the margin status is made difficult by the fragmentation of the received specimen  note is made of the association of the residual infiltrating tumor to changes consistent with a previous biopsy site and of the absence of tumor in parts C and D  findings suggestive of a negative final margin status.  Correlation with the clinical findings is recommended  also for assessment of the tumor size  which is here staged according to the largest tumor focus identified.Pathology Staging Summary*Specimen type: lumpectomy *Specimen size: 10.5 cm *Tumor size: two foci  6 and 5 mm respectively *Laterality: left *Tumor type present: invasive ductal carcinoma   cribriform type *Size of invasive component: two foci  6 and 5 mm respectively *Histologic grade: grade 1 *Nuclear grade: grade 1 *Vascular invasion: not definitively identified *Calcifications within benign component: present *Surgical margins for the invasive component: see comment *Lymph node sampling: Sentinel lymph node(s) only *Number of metastatic nodes/total number of nodes examined: 0/1; . *Pathologic Stage (AJCC 6th Edition): pT1 pN0(i-)(sn) pMX  see commentSpecial studies (estrogen and progesterone receptors  mib-1 and HER-2/neu by FISH) have not been ordered on this specimen  as they had already been performed on the previous biopsy (SP-09-14717) and were reported as follows: *ER/PR hormone receptors: ER positive ; PR positive *Nuclear proliferation index (mib-1): low *HER-2/neu by FISH: negative C)  BREAST  LEFT SUPERIOR MEDIAL  ADDITIONAL MARGIN  EXCISION:1.

The results will be issued in an addendum.Comment:  Encapsulated papillary carcinoma has been considered a variant of DCIS.  However studies have failed to demonstrate a layer of myoepithelial cells at the periphery of the the tumor nodules of encapsulated papillary carcinoma  as in this case.  This observation raises the possibility that these lesions  could be a form of low-grade invasive carcinoma with an expansile growth pattern. When invasive carcinoma is present in association with an encapsulated papillary carcinoma  it is recommended to report only the size of the invasive component.  Whether encapsulated papillary carcinoma are considered in situ or invasive in nature  outcome studies have demonstrate that they are associated with an excellent prognosis with adequate local therapy alone.

The invasive carcinoma is adjacent to the previous biopsy site measuring on a single slide 0.4 cm.  The previous core biopsy was reviewed with this case (SV09-10239).  In the core  invasive carcinoma is present involving multiple fragments  with the largest area measuring 0.6 cm.  The invasive carcinoma is at least 0.6 cm (T1b)  however  it is possibly that it is over 1 cm (T1c)  but it cannot be determined precisely.  Correlation with imaging findings is recommended.

Small foci of invasive ductal carcinoma within lymphovascular spaces (see comment).COMMENT:  The core biopsies consist mostly of benign breast parenchyma with only two areas characterized by small clusters of neoplastic cells consistent with invasive ductal carcinoma within lymphovascular spaces.  Positivity for D2-40 (lymphatic marker) in this areas and the absence of a myoepithelial cell layer (negative with SMMHC and P63 myoepithelial markers) support the impression of carcinoma within lymphovascular spaces.  The neoplastic cells are positive for e-cadherin immunostain supporting a ductal-type carcinoma.  FISH for HER-2 has not been ordered due to the scant amount of tumor cells present and should be performed in the excisional specimen.Sections are stained for estrogen and progesterone receptors by an immunohistochemical technique and HER-2/neu by FISH.  The proliferation rate is determined with an immunohistochemical stain for mib-1.  The results are as follows:Estrogen Receptor:  Positive (approximately 70%)Progesterone Receptor:  Positive (50%  weak-to-moderate staining)Proliferation Rate (mib-1):  Not performedHER-2/neu by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH):  Not performed in this sample due to scant tumor presentCOMMENT:  Performance of the immunologic reagents utilized in the above report have been characterized by Providence Portland Medical Center.

COMMENT:  The results of the immunoperoxidase stains favor a squamous carcinoma  however a metaplastic breast carcinoma is not entirely ruled out given the equivocal mammaglobin result.  Also  there is focal positivity with CEA  raising the remote possibility of an adenosquamous carcinoma. Glandular formation is not identified on the H&E stained specimen.  Part B has received intramural consultation from Dr. Sanaa Hussain  pulmonary pathologist  who concurs with squamous origin or immunophenotype.In conclusion  a clinical pulmonary primary needs to be excluded  especially in view of the strongly positive cytokeratin 7 and negative cytokeratin 20 immunoperoxidase stain.

Superior orange-inked surgical margin is focally positive for carcinoma and the inferior margin is approximately 1 mm from tumor; other margins are negative.4.  Breast atrophy.5.  No definitive lymphatic or vascular invasion identified.6.  Perineural invasion is present.COMMENT:  According to an outside biopsy report from Legacy Diagnostic Services  the patient was reported to have a left breast biopsy on 06/25/09  reportedly an invasive malignant neoplasm with negative estrogen receptor  negative progesterone receptor   with a high proliferative rate (mib-1).  Due to the negative ER/PR studies  these were repeated; see below. The case was reviewed by Dr. S. Schnitt at Harvard/Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston  MA.  A copy of his consultative report is located in Physician Portal.  He states  This unusual tumor has in many areas a nested pattern of infiltration  and the cells comprising the nests are large with moderate to marked nuclear atypia and numerous mitotic figures.  This nested pattern of infiltration raises the possibility of a solid variant of adenoid cystic carcinoma with basaloid features or  less likely  a carcinoma arising in association with microglandular adenosis. Although no basement membrane-like material or luminal epithelial differentiation is seen on the H&E stained sections  the histologic features and immunophenotype favor a diagnosis of a poorly differentiated adenoid cystic carcinoma.After discussing the case with Dr. Schnitt's fellow on 7/28/09  I have communicated a verbal diagnosis to Dr. Kelvin Yu on 7/29/09 at approximately 11:05 am.  Sections are stained for estrogen and progesterone receptors by an immunohistochemical technique and HER-2/neu by FISH.  The proliferation rate is determined with an immunohistochemical stain for mib-1.  The results are as follows:Estrogen Receptor:  NegativeProgesterone Receptor:  NegativeProliferation Rate (mib-1):  Markedly elevated greater than 70% of the neoplastic cellsHER-2/neu by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH):  Invasive carcinoma  negative for amplification of HER-2/neu gene by FISH study.  The average score per tumor cell is 3.0 for HER-2/neu gene and 2.5 for CEN-17 control.  The HER-2/neu to CEN-17 ratio is 1.2.  The tumor cells are also negative for overexpression of HER-2/neu oncoprotein by immunohistochemical study.  The score is 0.

COMMENT:  Although the tumor is weakly positive with estrogen receptor  some neoplastic nuclei are weakly positive with the TTF-1 (pulmonary marker).  Some lung carcinomas may express weakly positive estrogen receptor  and therefore  clinical correlation is advised.  The E-cadherin is not specific for breast origin. Although additional breast marker studies  such as mammoglobin and BRST-2  were performed  these did not highlight the neoplasm; however  this does not exclude a breast primary in view of the fact that the tumor is poorly differentiated and may not express the appropriate antigens.The TTF-1 is being repeated  and an addendum will follow. On morphologic basis alone  a breast primary is favored.Sections are stained for estrogen and progesterone receptors by an immunohistochemical technique and HER-2/neu by FISH.  The proliferation rate is determined with an immunohistochemical stain for mib-1.

Given the overall medial-to-lateral gross dimension of 4.5 cm  this extent of invasive carcinoma would correspond to the gross tumor measurement of 1.7 cm greatest dimension.  The invasive carcinoma component would not exceed 2 cm based on this calculation.

Immunohistochemically  the tumor is positive for WT-1  CK7  ER (strong positivity >80%) and PR (patchy positivity in approximately 20%); and is negative for mammaglobin  BRST-2 and CK20. In addition  the tumor is morphologically and immunhistochemically different from this patients breast carcinoma (see SV09-13594).  The morphologic and immunohistochemical features are consistent with a high grade serous carcinoma and given the distribution of the tumor  the findings are consistent with a primary peritoneal serous carcinoma.

The above diagnosis incorporates her interpretation.  In conjunction with the findings of the excisional biopsy and the features of the lesion present in the core biopsy  the diagnosis of a matrix-producing carcinoma is favored (Yale Pathology report  S09-18877).  Another consideration given the different immunophenotype of the tumor cells present particularly in the core biopsy  is the possibility of carcinoma arising in a pleomorphic adenoma (carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma). Matrix (chondroid)-producing carcinomas are considered in the category of metaplastic carcinomas  tumors composed by a component of an infiltrating carcinoma mixed with heterologous mesenchymal elements  in this case a chondroid matrix.

COMMENT:  Sections demonstrate involvement of the breast parenchyma by an inflammatory process characterized by the presence of numerous lymphocytes  plasma cells and histiocytic forms admixed with occasional multinucleated foreign body type giant cells.  Of note  features diagnostic of invasive or in situ carcinoma are not identified  a finding supported by the results of keratin stains (AE1/AE3  Cam 5.2)  failing to demonstrate evidence of an infiltrative epithelial component .  Stains for fungi and for acid-fast resistant mycobacteria (respectively  GMS/PAS and AFB) are negative.  No definitive polarizable or birefringent foreign material is identified.  In summary  these findings appear to be most consistent with an extensive granulomatous mastitis.  Case seen in consultation with Dr. Maritza Martel  who concurs with this interpretation  and discussed with Dr. Imatani.

Five lymph nodes  negative for malignancy (see comment).COMMENT:  In the current part A left breast specimen  the invasive carcinoma in the lower-outer quadrant has a histologic pattern of infiltrating lobular carcinoma with single-filing and trabecular arrangement of the neoplastic cells.  The invasive carcinoma in this area of the current case is compared to the H&E and immunohistochemical slides of the invasive carcinoma in the patient's prior left breast needle core biopsy (SV-09-1408)  which was diagnosed as an invasive pleomorphic lobular carcinoma based on the histologic pattern and E-cadherin immunohistochemical stain result. The invasive carcinoma in these areas of both cases has similar features. Based on this  the lesion in the current Part A left breast specimen is classified as an infiltrating pleomorphic lobular carcinoma.In the current part D right breast specimen  no residual carcinoma is identified in any of the sections.  The patient has had prior needle core biopsies from the right breast in January of 2009 (SV-09-1408) which were diagnosed as infiltrating ductal carcinoma.  Per the patient's operative report for the current case on Physician Portal  the patient has undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a reported excellent response.  This would correlate with the absence of residual carcinoma identified in the histologic sections from the right breast specimen. Based on these findings  the classification of the T stage for the right breast tumor would need to be based on clinical and radiologic measurements of the tumor size prior to treatment.In the current part E right axillary specimen  five lymph nodes are examined  all of which are negative for malignancy.  The patient's prior needle core biopsy of the right axilla from January of 2009 (SV-09-1408) was diagnosed as fragments of lymph node with metastatic breast carcinoma. These slides are reviewed and show metastatic carcinoma spanning up to 2.2 mm in these sections; however  the overall extent of metastatic carcinoma is likely larger given that the tumor extends to the edges of the tissue sections and these are needle core biopsies. Evaluation for extranodal tumor extension cannot be reliably assessed in these prior needle core biopsies. Based on the combined findings from the two cases  the N stage would be classified as pN1a in the right breast lymph nodes.Pathology Staging Summary (left breast)*Specimen type:  Simple mastectomy and separate sentinel lymph node biopsies*Specimen size (for specimens less than total mastectomy):  N/A*Tumor size:  1.8 cm greatest dimension*Laterality (right versus left):  Left*Tumor type(s) present:  Infiltrating lobular carcinoma  pleomorphic type*Size of invasive component:  1.8 cm*Histologic grade:  3/3*Nuclear grade:  2/3Grade of DCIS:  N/ADCIS component of invasive carcinoma (extensive vs not extensive):  N/ACalcification: Within benign component:  Not identified Within in situ component:  N/A Within invasive component:  Not identifiedVascular invasion:  Not identified*Tumor site (UOQ  UIQ  LOQ  LIQ  central  unknown):  Lower-outer quadrantTumor multicentricity:  NoTumor multifocality:  No*Nipple:  Negative for malignancy*Skin:  Negative for malignancy*Surgical margins (distance from closest margin must be stated for both invasive and DCIS components):  Invasive carcinoma greater than 1 cm removed from all surgical marginsLymph nodes:*Lymph node sampling: Sentinel lymph node(s) only*Lymph node status is as follows: *Number of metastatic nodes/total number of nodes examined:  0/2 *Extension beyond nodal capsule:  N/A *Nodes fixed to one another or to other structures:  N/A*TNM stage:  pT1c  pN0(i-)(sn)  MXSpecial studies: ER/PR hormone receptors:  Positive (100%)/positive (100%) Nuclear proliferation index (mib-1):  Intermediate HER-2/neu by FISH:  Negative for amplification of HER-2/neu gene.

The AJCC stage is  pT1c N0 MX  this would also be the same stage if the larger size of the posterior biopsy site was used alone.  Correlation with clinical and radiology studies is suggested.For Part C  endometrial curettings  suggest additional tissue sampling as clinically indicated.

Within the fibrous stroma can be seen breast ductules arranged in lobular architecture as well as occasional larger ducts.  Focally  some ductules are involved by a proliferation of ductal epithelial cells.  These epithelial cells have small  round oval nuclei with limited variability in size.  Some of these proliferative regions show more columnar epithelial cells with some apical blebbing.  The proliferation forms luminal spaces which are of variable size and shape in most regions.  Small areas show more regular luminal formation but this involvement measures less than 1 mm in a given lobule.  The findings are interpreted to represent ductal epithelial hyperplasia  including columnar cell hyperplasia  with foci of atypical ductal hyperplasia and columnar cell hyperplasia with atypia.  Some foci of the proliferating epithelial cells in these areas are focally negative on immunohistochemical stain for cytokeratin 5/6  which would support the H&E impression of focal atypical ductal hyperplasia/columnar cell hyperplasia with atypia.  The findings do not meet criteria for diagnosis of DCIS in these sections.  Immunohistochemical stains for smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and p63 demonstrate the presence of a myoepithelial layer around the ductules and ducts  confirming the H&E impression of lack of evidence for invasive carcinoma.  The remainder of the sections show fibrocystic changes with cystic dilatation of benign ductules.  Microcalcifications are associated within breast ductules.  Focal mild scattering of chronic inflammatory cells can be seen around a few benign breast ductules.

However  focal areas show a slightly irregular infiltrating pattern with central fibrosis and focal desmoplastic reaction  suspicious for invasion.  The neoplastic cells are large in size with increased N:C ratio  fine chromatin  multiple prominent nucleoli and increased mitoses  and show focal minimal ductal formation.  Immunohistochemical stains were performed to characterize the nature of the neoplasm and to rule out the possibility of invasive carcinoma.  The stains show the neoplastic cells to be strongly positive for E-cadherin with the lack of peripheral myoepithelial layer (smooth muscle heavy chain and p63 positive cells) in the entire nodule.  This finding indicates the entire tumor nodule is an invasive ductal carcinoma involving lobular units.  The tumor extends close to the inked margin (within 1 mm)  but the inked surface is free of tumor.  No angiolymphatic space invasion by tumor is identified.The final diagnosis was discussed with Dr. Clifford Canepa at approximately 1:30 on June 15th  2009.Intradepartmental consultation was performed by Dr. Sidney Rosenheim  who concurs with the diagnosis of invasive  poorly differentiated ductal carcinoma.

The stains show the neoplastic cells to be strongly positive for keratin 7 and E-cadherin  but negative for keratin 20  TTF-1  BRST-2 and mammoglobin. The negativity of TTF-1 rules out the possibility of metastatic pulmonary carcinoma.  The negativity of BRST-2 and mammoglobin neither supports nor completely rules out the possibility of primary breast carcinoma  as these two markers show high specificity  but low sensitivity with less than 50% positive rate in poorly differentiated breast carcinomas.  However  the overall histologic findings as well as clinical and radiographic observations are consistent with primary breast carcinoma.

The tumor is aggregated into nests with central necrosis and are composed of hyperchromatic cells with minimal eosinophilic cytoplasm.  In some areas  the cytoplasm is clear.  Immunohistochemical studies show the tumor to be extensively positive for CK5/6  and only focally positive for p63  CK7  and CK20.  It is also focally positive for CDX-2 and positive for p16.  It is negative for vimentin  WT-1  HepPar-1  TTF-1  chromogranin  synaptophysin  BRST-2  and ER.  This immunoprofile tends to exclude hepatocellular carcinoma  neuroendocrine carcinoma  and metastatic breast and lung adenocarcinoma  as well as serous carcinoma of the ovary.

Poorly differentiated carcinoma (see microscopic description and comment).  COMMENT:  The case is discussed with the clinician  Dr. Ivan Law.  Dr. Law states that the patient has diffuse adenopathy involving the hilar  mediastinal and retroperitoneal regions.  The current specimen is from a retroperitoneal lymph node.  Dr. Law states that the patient apparently had a prior diagnosis in December  2008 at Good Samaritan Hospital which was interpreted to represent poorly differentiated carcinoma. The patient's clinical findings are reviewed on Physician Portal. A PET scan report of May 20  2009 describes increased uptake in the lymph node regions described above as well as in supraclavicular lymph nodes and multiple lesions in the spleen.The immunohistochemical profile is not specific. The lesion is a poorly differentiated carcinoma based on positive staining for AE1/AE3 and cytokeratin 7 and absence of staining for melanoma associated markers (S100 and Melan-A) and lymphoid associated marker (CD45). BerEP4  a marker associated with many adenocarcinomas  is negative here and evidence of specific differentiation is not seen on H&E stains. The carcinoma is cytokeratin 7 positive and cytokeratin 20 negative; this profile can be seen with carcinomas of lung  breast  upper GI and gynecologic primary origins. No evidence of a primary lesion is described in any of these sites on the PET scan. The lack of staining for estrogen receptor  BRST-2 and mammaglobin would argue against a breast primary. The negative estrogen receptor would also argue against a gynecologic primary and the negative WT-1 would argue specifically against a serous gynecologic tumor. CD56 and synaptophysin are negative  which would argue against a neuroendocrine carcinoma. TTF-1 is negative  which would argue against a lung adenocarcinoma primary. Cytokeratin 5/6 is negative and p63 is focally positive; squamous carcinomas  of lung or upper GI origin  while expressing p63  are typically positive for cytokeratin 5/6 as well. Villin is negative  which does not by itself exclude the possibility of an upper GI primary  including pancreaticobiliary origin  and a minority of these carcinomas can show some expression for p63.In this setting with positive hilar  mediastinal  supraclavicular and retroperitoneal lymph nodes as well as spleen  origin from lung and upper GI primary sources  including panceaticobiliary origin  should be considered; however  the immunohistochemical profile is not definitive and lesions are not described clinically in these regions. Therefore  correlation with clinical and radiologic information would be required to determine if a primary lung or upper GI source  including pancreaticobiliary origin  is present or whether another primary source can be identified.

Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (see microscopic description and comment).  COMMENT:  Review of the patient's clinical information on Physician Portal reveals an abdominal ultrasound report of May 19  2009 which describes multiple lesions within the liver as well as a lesion in the uncinate process of the pancreas and a lesion in the right kidney.  The findings of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with positive cytokeratin-7 expression and absence of cytokeratin-20 expression can be seen with adenocarcinomas of lung  breast  gynecologic and upper GI primary sources  including pancreaticobiliary origin.  The cytokeratin-7 positive/ cytokeratin-20 negative profile would argue against a renal primary source and this same profile  as well as the negative Heppar stain  would argue against hepatocellular carcinoma.  The lack of staining for estrogen receptor and brst-2 would argue against a breast primary source.  The absence of staining for estrogen receptor would also argue against a gynecologic primary source.  The absence of TTF-1 would argue against a lung primary source.  The histologic findings and immunohistochemical profile would favor a primary cholangiocarcinoma  although metastasis from an upper gastrointestinal source  including pancreas  would need to be considered  since immunohistochemical markers do not reliably distinguish carcinomas of biliary tract origin from upper GI and pancreatic origin.  Clinical correlation would therefore be required in this regard.  CONSULTATION:  Xiaohong Cai  M.D.  Ph.D.  Gastrointestinal Pathologist

Ductal carcinoma in situ  high grade  with necrosis.  2.  Microcalcifications are identified in association with the DCIS.  COMMENT:  Sections demonstrate the presence of a ductal intraepithelial proliferation characterized by the presence of markedly atypical epithelial elements associated with comedo-type necrosis and with focal microcalcifications.  These findings are consistent with involvement by high grade DCIS.  Features diagnostic of invasion are not identified in this core biopsy material.  The performed immunohistochemical stains demonstrate the neoplastic cells are positive for E-cadherin and show 3+ (100%) positivity for ER and demonstrate 2+ positive (80%) PR positivity.  A stain for smooth muscle markers (SMMHC) demonstrate the presence of an appropriately preserved myoepithelial layer surrounding the carcinoma in situ forms.Case seen in consultation with Dr. Maritza Martel  who concurs with this interpretation.

Focally in one portion of the core are epithelial cells which are atypical.  These are characterized by high N/C ratios with hyperchromatic irregular nuclei with prominent nucleoli.  These seem to be invading through the stroma.  There is an extensive reactive lymphoid population within the cores.  Immunohistochemical studies are performed and evaluated.  These demonstrate that tumor cells are positive for CK7 and TTF-1 and negative for CK20  CDX-2  CK5/6  p63 and BRST-2.  The negative stains help to exclude GI and breast primary sites as well as squamous cell carcinoma.

The findings are most consistent with involvement by invasive lobular carcinoma  an impression also supported by the performed immunohistochemical stains demonstrating that the neoplastic elements are positive for cytokeratin 903  while negative for E-cadherin and beta catenin.  Stains for p63 and SMMHC confirm the absence of a surrounding myoepithelial layer.  Of note  the degree of pleomorphism of the neoplastic lobular elements  although variable in this limited biopsy material  appears focally suggestive of the possibility of a pleomorphic variant of lobular carcinoma.

High grade malignant sarcomatoid neoplasm of the breast (see comment).2.  The tumor ulcerates the overlying skin and measures 19 cm in greatest dimension  involves skeletal muscle and focally extends to less than 1 mm from the deep resection margin (Part B pectoralis muscle is negative)  all other margins are negative for tumor. 3.  The uninvolved breast shows no significant pathologic changes.4.  Seven lymph nodes  all negative for malignancy (0/7).  5.  Vascular invasion is identified.B)  PECTORALIS MUSCLE  EXCISION:1.  Benign skeletal muscle and fibroadipose  tissue. COMMENT:  This is an unusual neoplasm characterized predominantly by a sarcomatoid morphology consisting of spindle cells  and only focally a minor tubular component was identified admixed with the spindle cell component  consistent with glandular differentiation.  Positivity for keratin stains in the tubular component as well as in some areas in the spindle cell component  would suggest that this a metaplastic sarcomatoid carcinoma of the breast with almost a pure sarcomatoid appearance. FISH for SYT and EWS performed were negative excluding the diagnosis of synovial sarcoma.  Myoepithelial carcinoma and spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma  would be unlikely since the tumor is negative for myoepithelial cell markers and markers of squamous differentiation.  Areas suggesting an origin in a phyllodes tumor with sarcomatous overgrowth or carcinosarcoma arising in a phyllodes tumor were not identified in the sections examined.Tumors with these features are rare and their biological potential and optimal therapy difficult to predict. Recent studies have suggested that metaplastic sarcomatoid carcinomas that have a pure or almost pure sarcomatoid appearance (as this case does)  have a biologic behavior similar to that of sarcomas  being aggressive neoplasms with a high rate of extranodal metastasis (most frequently lung) with a significantly lower rate of nodal metastases than conventional ductal and lobular carcinomas.   Am J Surg Pathol 2006  Vol. 30 (3); Am J Surg Pathol 2005  Vol. 29 (11).Sections are stained for estrogen and progesterone receptors by an immunohistochemical technique and HER-2/neu by FISH.  The proliferation rate is determined with an immunohistochemical stain for mib-1.  The results are as follows:Estrogen Receptor:  focally positive (<5%  only in minor glandular component  spindle cell component is negative)Progesterone Receptor:  focally positive (<5%  only in minor glandular component  spindle cell component is negative)Proliferation Rate (mib-1): HighHER-2/neu by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH):  pendingBlock examined:  A28COMMENT:  Performance of the immunologic reagents utilized in the above report have been characterized by Providence Portland Medical Center.  Except for HER-2/neu by FISH  these reagents have not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Metastatic carcinoma involving one of twelve lymph nodes (1/12); metastatic carcinoma measures 3.5 mm in greatest dimension; extranodal tumor extension not identified; isolated tumor cells (0.15 mm or less in greatest dimension) involving a separate lymph node [see comment].COMMENT:  In the part C lumpectomy specimen  the neoplasm forms an ill-defined lesion grossly.  The size of the invasive and in situ ductal carcinoma is therefore calculated from the extent of involvement in the sections from the gross slices.  The invasive carcinoma involves nine sequential gross slices out of a total of twelve gross slices proceeding from medial to lateral.  Given that the overall gross dimension from medial to lateral measures 4.7 cm in the intact specimen  this extent of invasive carcinoma is calculated to span approximately 3.5 cm in the gross specimen.  The invasive carcinoma is therefore classified as a pT2 tumor stage based on this size calculation. The DCIS involves eleven sequential gross slices out of a total of twelve gross slices proceeding from medial to lateral.  Based on the same medial to lateral measurement of the intact gross specimen  this extent of DCIS is calculated to span approximately 4.3 cm in the gross specimen.A total of fifteen lymph nodes are identified in the combined parts A  B and D specimens.  In these combined specimens  metastatic carcinoma involves three of the lymph nodes with the metastatic carcinoma measuring 2.5 mm  3.5 mm and 1.4 cm in greatest dimension in these lymph nodes.  In addition  a separate lymph node in part D shows isolated tumor cells measuring 0.15 mm or less in greatest dimension.  By convention  the lymph node containing isolated tumor cells is not counted as an additional positive lymph node in terms of the lymph node staging classification and the lymph node staging is therefore classified as pN1a based on the involvement of the three lymph nodes described.Pathology Staging Summary*Specimen type:  Lumpectomy with separate lymph node specimens*Specimen size (for specimens less than total mastectomy):  4.7 cm lateral to medial  3.4 cm superior to inferior and 2.5 cm anterior to posterior*Tumor size:  Invasive carcinoma calculated to span 3.5 cm in greatest dimension (see comment)*Laterality (right versus left):  Left*Tumor type(s) present:  Infiltrating ductal carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ*Size of invasive component:  Invasive carcinoma calculated to span approximately 3.5 cm in greatest dimension (see comment)*Histologic grade:  3/3*Nuclear grade:  3/3Grade of DCIS:  High-gradeDCIS component of invasive carcinoma (extensive vs not extensive):  ExtensiveCalcification: Within benign component:  Not identified Within in situ component:  Not identified Within invasive component:  Not identifiedVascular invasion:  Lymphatic tumor involvement identified*Tumor site (UOQ  UIQ  LOQ  LIQ  central  unknown):  UnknownTumor multicentricity:  NoTumor multifocality:  No*Nipple:  N/A*Skin:  N/A*Surgical margins (distance from closest margin must be stated for both invasive and DCIS components):  Invasive carcinoma 1 mm from posterior surgical margin  3 mm from anterior and superior surgical margins  6 mm from inferior surgical margin  7 mm from lateral surgical margin and greater than 1 cm removed from medial surgical margin; DCIS involves superior surgical margin  2 mm from anterior surgical margin  3 mm from posterior and lateral surgical margins  7 mm from medial surgical margin and greater than 1 cm removed from inferior surgical marginLymph nodes:*Lymph node sampling: Sentinel lymph node with axillary dissection*Lymph node status is as follows: *Number of metastatic nodes/total number of nodes examined:  3/12 (isolated tumor cells also present in separate lymph node) [see comment *Extension beyond nodal capsule:  No *Nodes fixed to one another or to other structures:  No*TNM stage:  pT2  pN1a  MX (see comment)Special studies: ER/PR hormone receptors:  Positive (100%)/positive (60%) Nuclear proliferation index (mib-1):  High HER-2/neu by FISH:  Negative for amplification of HER-2/neu gene.

Superior  lateral and inferior margins are positive for invasive lobular carcinoma; invasive lobular carcinoma is also present less than 1 mm from the medial margin.3.  Lymphovascular invasion is not identified.4.  Previous biopsy site and therapy-related changes are identified.Comment:  Keratin immunostains were performed on multiple blocks to assess the extent of residual invasive lobular carcinoma and margins.  Although therapy-related changes are seen with a fibroelastotic stroma  numerous sparse and scattered residual cells of invasive lobular carcinoma are identified in sections from all slices (slices #1 to13).  The specimen measured 5.8 cm from anterior to posterior and was cut into thirteen slices  therefore  the area of involvement of invasive carcinoma is  estimated as 5.8 cm (AJCC TNM stage ypT3).  Evaluating the response to chemotherapy based on the tumor cellularity in cases of invasive lobular carcinoma may be difficult since the pretreatment cellularity may be low as lobular carcinoma often diffusely infiltrate as single cells and files  and the pretreatment biopsy is not available for comparison.  Using the Miller-Payne grading system to evaluate tumor response to preoperative chemotherapy  is estimated to correspond to a grade 3 (out of 5) (between an estimated 30% and 90% reduction in tumor cells  pathologic partial response).

Immunohistochemical stains demonstrate that the atypical ductal structures lack of expression of CK5/6 while retaining expression of CK903.  A stain for ER is positive in the atypical ductal epithelium.  These findings are compatible with the impression of atypical ductal hyperplasia.

COMMENT:  The specimen is designated as left breast tissue plus additional lateral margin.  The specimen is received as two fragments  neither of which has evidence of orientation.  The larger specimen containing the biopsy cavity and the needle localization wire is presumed to be the excisional biopsy specimen.  DCIS focally involves the inked tissue surface in one section from this larger fragment and DCIS comes to within less than 0.5 mm of the inked tissue surface in a second section from this larger fragment. In the smaller fragment  DCIS is present that comes to within less than 0.5 mm of the inked tissue surface.  However  given the lack of orientation of the fragments  the exact location of the DCIS within the two individual fragments is unclear and the spatial relationship of the fragments relative to one another cannot be assessed with certainty either; based on this  the status of the true final surgical margins is uncertain.

Invasive  carcinoma involving all core biopsies  extensively  consistent with pleomorphic lobular type  solid type.  COMMENT:  A verbal report was given to Dr. Nishikawa  who was covering for Dr. Mayer in his absence.  I discussed with her the possibility that a metastatic gynecologic neoplasm or lung primary have not been ruled out completely.  In view of the elevated mib-1 and negative BRST-2 and mammoglobin breast markers  I am concerned that this is unusual histology for a pleomorphic lobular cancer  and with the history of a hysterectomy  I would like to be reassured that she had no prior gynecological malignancy  which may have metastasized to the breast.  Also  a lung primary may present as an estrogen receptor positive neoplasm.  Therefore  I have ordered TTF-1 and WT-1 as additional markers to rule out lung or a serous ovarian neoplasm.  Dr. Nishikawa was unsure about the year in which the patient's hysterectomy was performed.  A prolonged interval may be helpful in ruling out metastatic neoplasm.Sections are stained for estrogen and progesterone receptors by an immunohistochemical technique and HER-2/neu by FISH.  The proliferation rate is determined with an immunohistochemical stain for mib-1.  The results are as follows:Estrogen Receptor:  Strongly positive (100%)Progesterone Receptor:  NegativeProliferation Rate (mib-1):  Elevated  greater than 50%HER-2/neu by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH):  PendingBlock examined:  A1COMMENT:  Performance of the immunologic reagents utilized in the above report have been characterized by Providence Portland Medical Center.

The neoplastic cells are large in size with oval to irregular nuclear contours  fine chromatin  inconspicuous nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. No mucin production is found.The subsequent immunostains show the neoplastic glands to be positive for pankeratin  keratin 7 and CEA-m  but negative for TTF-1  keratin 20  BRST-2  mammoglobin  ER and renal cell carcinoma markers.  The negativity of keratin 20 essentially rules out the possibility of metastatic colorectal carcinoma.  The negativity of BRST-2  mammoglobin and ER argues against the possibility of metastatic breast carcinoma.  The negativity of RCC does not support metastatic renal cell carcinoma.  Given the clinical presentation of lung mass  the overall morphologic and immunophenotypical findings are most suggestive of metastatic adenocarcinoma of pulmonary primary  despite the fact that the immunostain for TTF-1 is negative in this case.  Clinical and radiographic correlation is recommended for complete interpretation.

The non-neoplastic pulmonary tissue of the right middle lobe wedge biopsy shows chronic inflammation  type II cell hyperplasia and focal fibrosis.  To characterize the nature of the carcinoma  a panel of immunostains was performed on tissue block A2.  The stains show the carcinoma cells to be positive for keratin AE1/AE3 and keratin 7  but negative for keratin 20  TTF-1  CDx-2  BRST-2  ER  hepatocyte  thyroglobulin  synaptophysin  chromogranin and calcitonin.  The immunohistochemical results may rule out the possibility of metastatic adenocarcinoma from colon  breast  liver  thyroid (including calcitonin producing medullary carcinoma)  but do not exclude the possibility of metastatic adenocarcinoma from upper GI  biliary  pancreas and other sites.  Furthermore  the negativity of TTF-1 neither supports nor completely excludes the possibility of adenocarcinoma of pulmonary primary.  Therefore  clinical and radiographic correlation is recommended for complete interpretation.Intradepartmental consultation was performed by Drs. Sidney Rosenheim and Chris Cai  who concur with the above diagnoses and interpretation.

The largest dimension of residual invasive carcinoma in the breast tissue in the current right mastectomy specimen measures 9 mm; however  correlation with the prior right breast lumpectomy findings would be required in order to properly classify the T stage for this lesion. A single lymph node is found in the right mastectomy specimen in the current case  after initial dissection and following second dissection after DissectAid treatment. This single lymph node is negative for malignancy; however  clinical correlation with the prior right axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy findings would be required to properly classify the N stage for this lesion.Pathology Staging Summary*Specimen type:  mastectomy*Specimen size (for specimens less than total mastectomy):  N/A*Tumor size:  residual invasive carcinoma 9 mm greatest dimension*Laterality (right versus left):  right*Tumor type(s) present:  residual infiltrating ductal carcinoma*Size of invasive component:  residual invasive carcinoma 9 mm in greatest dimension*Histologic grade:  3*Nuclear grade:  2Grade of DCIS:  N/ADCIS component of invasive carcinoma (extensive vs not extensive):  N/AVascular invasion:  not identified*Tumor site (UOQ  UIQ  LOQ  LIQ  central  unknown):  upper-outer quadrantTumor multicentricity:  noTumor multifocality:  no*Nipple:  negative for malignancy*Skin:  negative for malignancy*Surgical margins (distance from closest margin must be stated for both invasive and DCIS components):  invasive carcinoma 1 mm from posterior surgical margin and greater than 1 cm removed from anterior/superior and anterior/inferior surgical marginsLymph nodes:*Lymph node sampling: Axillary dissection (see comment)*Lymph node status is as follows: *Number of metastatic nodes/total number of nodes examined: 0/1 in current case (see comment) *Extension beyond nodal capsule:  N/A *Nodes fixed to one another or to other structures:  N/A*TNM stage: correlation with prior right breast lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy findings required for accurate classification (see comment)Special studies: ER/PR hormone receptors:  ordered Nuclear proliferation index (mib-1): ordered HER-2/neu by FISH:  ordered Block:  B2

In cases like this one with biopsy-site changes associated with a neoplasm  special studies have often been performed previously.  If needed  these tests can be ordered on the current case (block B5 or B23) upon request.Comment: In part B  two separate fragments were received  one with a wire and one without a wire.  In both fragments invasive ductal carcinoma is present exhibiting similar morphologic features. Since both fragments appear to be contiguous in the breast  it is likely that the invasive carcinoma present in both fragments represents one tumor  therefore estimated to be close to 4 cm (pT2)   although a precise measurement is difficult to estimate.

Both tumors are morphologically similar and exhibit a focal single file pattern resembling invasive lobular carcinoma; however  per outside pathology report  e-cadherin immunostain is reported as positive  therefore supporting the diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma.   The previous core biopsy (SV09-236) was reviewed with this case and the tumor present is morphologically similar to the invasive carcinoma present in the mastectomy specimen.  It is noted that the tumors exhibits a poorly differentiated growth pattern with no tubule formation and a high mitotic index with mib-1;  however  an evaluation of the entire tumor and applying  the Nottingham combined histologic grading system  the tumor is graded as total score of 6/9  corresponding to a grade 2 (out of 3) (moderately differentiated) invasive ductal carcinoma.  In part C  one of the lymph nodes shows an area of metastatic carcinoma highlighted with a cytokeratin immunostain  measuring 2.5 mm.

Given the small size of the residual tumor  adequate staging is correlated with the prior biopsy sample  SV09-5845  which demonstrated a tumor of 0.5 cm in maximum linear length.  While adding of the tumor dimensions is not performed  given the radiologic findings  the tumor size is likely over 0.5 cm and less than 1 cm.  Therefore  the pTNM stage is as follows: pT1b N0 MX.

In the setting of invasive lobular carcinoma and other positive lymph nodes  this lymph node is considered as positive for metastatic carcinoma  resulting in 4/10 lymph nodes positive. Estimating a precise size of invasive carcinoma is difficult in cases with a previous excision and residual invasive carcinoma on a re-excision specimen. Taking into consideration that all the sections from the previous lumpectomy specimen  SV09-2858  measuring 3.5 cm  were involved by tumor  and that in the current specimen measured in a single slide the invasive carcinoma is 2.2 cm  although these to dimensions cannot be accurately added  the size of the invasive carcinoma is likely to be > 5 cm  therefore staged as pT3.

Invasive and in situ ductal carcinoma  see comment and staging summary.  2   The invasive component is nuclear grade 2  architectural grade 3  and measures approximately 4 cm in greatest dimension.3.  The invasive carcinoma extends focally to the anterior and superior resection margins and to less the 1 mm from the posterior margin.4.  Lymphovascular invasion is identified.  COMMENT:  Although the specimen appears macroscopically formed by two separate nodular lesions (see gross description)  measuring respectively 2.5 and 1.5 cm in greatest dimension  the tissue sampled between the two suspicious lesions (sections A8 and A9) appears to be extensively involved by tumor  a finding most consistent with an irregular single mass. Of note  this impression is reflected in the tumor size assessment (4 cm) used for the pathological staging.  Foci of lymphovascular invasion are identified in section A12.  Immunohistochemical stains confirm the presence of vascular invasion by demonstrating a layer of D2-40 and CD34+ endothelial cells around the tumor clusters involving the lymphovascular spaces  while a stain for SMMHC demonstrates the absence of a myoepithelial layer around these tumor nests.  The resection margins appear to be focally involved by tumor  with involvement of the anterior and superior margin  best shown in sections A2 and A6  respectively  and extension of the tumor  to less than 1 mm from the posterior resection margin (section A4).

Slice 6 includes additional biopsy cavity and extensive fibrocystic changes.Slices 7 through 9 are included on slides A9 through A14 and these demonstrate still additional healing biopsy site.  On A10 a less than a millimeter focus of atypical ductal hyperplasia is noted adjacent to the biopsy site.  The medial margin on A15 includes skin which shows no evidence of pagetoid involvement of the epidermis.  Likewise  the terminal lymphatics are negative for neoplasm. The entire set of paraffin blocks is radiographed and the microcalcifications are identified in blocks A3  A10 and A15.  These blocks are sectioned at levels.  The additional sections demonstrate proliferative breast tissue with cyst formation  usual papillary hyperplasia  apocrine metaplasia and foci of tall cell change.  No in situ or invasive carcinoma is identified.  The central biopsy cavity is included on slide A10 with its adjacent focus of atypical ductal hyperplasia.

At least partially  the lesion seems to be  well-circumscribed and surrounded by fibrous capsule suggestive of an encapsulated papillary carcinoma.  However  since only a fragment is present the possibility of an invasive component cannot be excluded in this biopsy.  Immunostains for the intraductal tumor cells (DCIS) are as follows:Estrogen receptor: positive (100%)Progesterone receptor: positive (100%)It should be noted that the results of these stains apply ONLY to this non-invasive tumor (DCIS).  Any possible invasive tumor found in a future breast specimen from this patient will have to be tested anew for ER and PR  because the results may not correlate with those of the DCIS.

Perivascular lymphocytic dermatitis  negative for malignant neoplasm of any type.COMMENT:  No neoplasm of any type is identified and in particular no infiltration of the epidermis or the dermis  including vascular spaces by carcinoma is present   by H&E sections and by pancytokeratin staining.The inflammatory pattern of perivascular lymphocytic dermatitis  is difficult to classify with specificity by histology alone.  It can be seen adjacent to innumerable inflammatory or neoplastic lesions. It can be associated with lesions such as tinea versicolor  dermatophytosis  etc; however  in our case no organisms of any type are identified within the cornified layer.  Viral exanthem of one type  drug eruption of one type  and erythema figuratum are also possibilities.  If clinical suspicion of neoplasm remains high  it is difficult to rule out sampling error with certainty and additional biopsy sampling would be a consideration. Clinical correlation is likely to yield optimal classification for this perivascular lymphocytic dermatitis involving left breast skin.Interpreted by James B.

The metastatic carcinoma in these eight lymph nodes ranges from 1.1 mm up to 1.9 cm in greatest dimension.  Two additional lymph nodes show isolated tumor cells which consist of tumor cell collections measuring less than 0.2 mm in greatest dimension apiece; by convention  these lymph nodes containing isolated tumor cells are not counted as additional positive lymph nodes.  These isolated tumor cells are identified on keratin stain and H&E stain in one of these lymph nodes (slide C1); in the second lymph node containing isolated tumor cells (slide C3)  the cells are identified on keratin immunohistochemical stains only.  Five additional lymph nodes are present which are negative for malignant cells on H&E and keratin immunohistochemical stains.

A biopsy cavity is also seen in the upper outer quadrant (UOQ) of this mastectomy specimen but no malignancy is identified associated with this biopsy cavity. The patient has had a prior left breast needle core biopsy (SV-08-13149) which was reported to contain an infiltrating ductal carcinoma at 2:00  which is interpreted to be from the UOQ. The left lumpectomy specimen (SV-08-16806)  which was a needle localized procedure performed after this needle core biopsy and assumed to also be from this 2:00 (UOQ) region  was reported to contain residual invasive lobular carcinoma  measuring 1.2 cm in greatest dimension  as well as focal low grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and focal lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). Based on the findings of invasive carcinoma in two separate quadrants of the breast  this is classified as a multicentric carcinoma. Although the LIQ invasive carcinoma measured 1.0 cm  the UOQ invasive carcinoma was reported to measure 1.2 cm and the carcinoma is staged as T1c on the basis of this larger carcinoma. The invasive carcinoma from the UOQ left breast needle core specimen was reported to be estrogen receptor positive (100%)  progesterone receptor positive (100%)  mib-1 proliferation rate low and HER-2/neu by FISH negative. Given that the LIQ invasive carcinoma in the current mastectomy specimen is from a different quadrant  these breast marker studies will be repeated on a block of tumor (A4) from the current specimen; results of these additional studies will follow in an addendum report.

Focal ductal hyperplasia  up to moderate  without atypia.COMMENT:  The specimen is received with a single orientation suture at the posterior aspect.  Based on this  the anterior and posterior aspects of the specimen can be oriented with certainty; however  the superior  inferior  lateral and medial aspects of the specimen cannot be oriented with certainty based on this single suture.  Because of this  the needle localization wire is used as a second orientation point.  With the specimen viewed from anterior to posterior  the long axis of the specimen (7.0 cm) running from 6:00 to 12:00 and the intermediate axis of the specimen (5.1 cm) running from 3:00 to 9:00  this needle localization wire exits the specimen at approximately the 10:00 region of the specimen.  The invasive carcinoma is 2.5 mm from the orange-inked margin in the sections  which covers the margin from 9:00 to 12:00 in this orientation.  Based on the closest approximation of invasive carcinoma to orange-inked margin involving gross slice 9  the invasive carcinoma is interpreted to be 2.5 mm from this orange-inked surgical margin at approximately the 10:00 region of the specimen given this orientation above. The findings are discussed with the surgeon  Dr. Garcia  who states that the bent aspect of the needle localization wire exits the specimen at the medial aspect of the specimen. Given the closest approximation of invasive carcinoma is also at this  point at which the wire exits the specimen (i.e.  10:00 given the orientation above)  the closest approximation of invasive carcinoma (2.5 mm) is to this medial margin. The green-inked  yellow-inked and purple-inked margins are all greater than 1 cm removed from the invasive carcinoma. The posterior and anterior surgical margins are 3 mm and 8 mm from the invasive carcinoma  respectively.Pathology Staging Summary*Specimen type:  lumpectomy*Specimen size (for specimens less than total mastectomy):  7.0 x 5.1 x 2.3 cm*Tumor size:  1.6 x 1.4 x 0.7 cm*Laterality (right versus left):  right*Tumor type(s) present:  infiltrating ductal carcinoma*Size of invasive component:  1.6 cm greatest dimension*Histologic grade:  3/3*Nuclear grade:  2/3Grade of DCIS:  N/ADCIS component of invasive carcinoma (extensive vs not extensive):  N/AVascular invasion:  not identified*Tumor site (UOQ  UIQ  LOQ  LIQ  central  unknown):  unknownTumor multicentricity:  noTumor multifocality:  no*Nipple:  N/A*Skin:  N/A*Surgical margins (distance from closest margin must be stated for both invasive and DCIS components):  invasive carcinoma 2.5 mm from medial surgical margin  3 mm from posteror surgical margin  8 mm from anterior surgical margin and greater than 1 cm removed from remaining surgical margins (see microscopic description and comment)Lymph nodes:*Lymph node sampling: No lymph node sampling*Lymph node status is as follows: *Number of metastatic nodes/total number of nodes examined:  N/A *Extension beyond nodal capsule:  N/A *Nodes fixed to one another or to other structures:  N/A*TNM stage:  T1c  NX  MXSpecial studies: ER/PR hormone receptors:  positive (3+)/negative Nuclear proliferation index (mib-1):  low (5%) HER-2/neu by FISH:  negative for amplification of HER-2/neu gene.

Block:  A2 (SP-09-1617)COMMENT:  The patient has had prior excisional biopsies from the left breast (SP-09-1617).  Invasive ductal carcinoma was identified involving the 6:00 biopsy in the left breast in this case  corresponding to the biopsy site region at the junction of the lower-inner quadrant/lower-outer quadrant in the current left mastectomy specimen.  The invasive carcinoma in this prior excisional biopsy is reported to have measured 9 mm.  Residual invasive carcinoma at this site in the mastectomy specimen measures 4 mm in greatest dimension.  It is uncertain what the exact size of the overall invasive carcinoma is in the combined specimens and the tumor stage is therefore based on the larger individual measurement of 9 mm in the excisional biopsy; based on this  the invasive carcinoma in the left breast is staged as a T1b tumor stage.

Ductal carcinoma in situ  grade 3  approximately 2.8 cm in greatest dimension  involving a complex sclerosing lesion and extending to the blue-inked resection margin  see comment and pathology summary.COMMENT:  The biopsy demonstrates the presence of intermediate-grade ductal carcinoma in situ.  The DCIS is present in seven of the submitted blocks  for a total estimated size of approximately 2.8 cm (7 x 0.4 cm of block thickness).  DCIS appears to extend to the blue-inked resection margin and involves an area of sclerosing adenosis. The DCIS focally also extends to 0.3 mm from the black-inked (medial/deep) margin (section A20).  The uninvolved breast parenchyma demonstrates the presence of extensive sclerosing adenosis and of a radial scar (section A4).  Immunohistochemical stains (SMMHC and P63) show a preserved myoepithelial layer  and demonstrate a retained e-cadherin expression associated to a loss of CK903 positivity. Calcifications are identified both in association with benign lesions such as the radial scar as well as in the DCIS component.  Changes consistent with a previous biopsy site are identified. Seen in consultation with Dr. M. Martel  who concurs with the above interpretation.Pathology summary*Specimen type: lumpectomy *Specimen size (for specimens less than total mastectomy): 7.5 cm *Laterality (right versus left): left *Tumor type(s) present: in-situ ductal carcinoma (DCIS) *Size of the in-situ ductal carcinoma: estimated at approximately 2.8 cm (7 blocks X 0.4 cm in thickness)  see comment *Grade of the in-situ ductal carcinoma: high grade; architectural patterns of growth: cribriform  solid *Grade of DCIS: grade 3*Calcification within benign component: present *Calcification within in situ component: present *Surgical margins for the DCIS component: DCIS extends to the blue inked margin and focally to 0.3 mm from the black inked margin (section A20) *The remaining breast shows: radial scar  sclerosing adenosis . *Previous biopsy site identified. *Lymph node sampling: No lymph node sampling

COMMENT:  The modified radical mastectomy shows the presence of two foci of invasive ductal carcinoma  measuring respectively 1.8 cm and 1.7 cm in greatest dimension.  The lesions are consistent with nuclear grade 2.  The smaller focus demonstrates  as in the previous breast biopsy material  more prominent mucinous differentiation.

Stains for p63 and SMMHC are negative  and confirm the invasive nature of the tumor  also failing to demonstrate foci of a definitive DCIS component. A focus suspicious for lymphovascular invasion is identified in block A4; stains for D2-40 and CD34 could not however confirm this finding  most likely due to the loss of the area of interest in the deeper tissue levels.

The history and physical of 1/22/2009 describes that a recent right breast biopsy was performed which was diagnosed as carcinoma. The H&P describes that this carcinoma is ER positive  PR negative and Her2/neu negative; no mib-1 proliferation rate result is described in the H&P. No recent right breast biopsy results are found in the Providence information system and it is assumed that this recent right breast biopsy and breast markers were performed at an outside institution. The breast marker studies can be performed on the current case  if needed  at the request of the clinician.

The two lesions appear morphologically similar  although note is made of a significantly more extensive evidence of mucinous differentiation in the biopsy labelled as A. The performed immunohistochemical stains show that the neoplastic elements are strongly positive for ER/PR in both biopsies (3+/100%)  while stains for SMMHC and p63 show no evidence of a preserved myoepithelial layer  a finding consistent with an invasive carcinoma. The results of HER-2 FISH studies will be reported in addendum. Case seen in consultation with Dr. M. Martel  who concurs with the above interpretation.

Residual invasive mammary carcinoma with therapy related changes  see comment and staging summary.COMMENT:  The lumpectomy specimen shows involvement by residual in situ and invasive carcinoma.  The invasive component is poorly differentiated and has a diffusely infiltrative pattern of growth  often characterized by the presence of single cells sparsely and extensively infiltrating a fibrous breast tissue.  Assessment of the invasive  carcinoma dimensions is difficult  due to the sparse and infiltrative nature of the tumor; although macroscopically felt to measure approximately 2.8 cm in greatest dimension  the latter measurement  most likely represents a significant  underestimation  given the presence of invasive tumor cells in most of the examined sampled tissue sections.  Of note  the  tumor extends along fibrovascular bundles into the surrounding fibroadipose tissue and focally is present at approximately 3 mm from the closest resection margin (superior  section A12).  In the performed immunohistochemical stains the neoplastic elements appear positive for keratins AE1/AE3 and  CK903  while negative for e-cadherin and beta-catenin. The in situ component measures approximately 1.3 cm in greatest dimension seen (section A1).  All resection margins are negative for in situ carcinoma.B)  LYMPH NODES  LEFT AXILLARY  EXCISION:1.

COMMENT:  The overall morphologic findings are most consistent with a portion of intracystic papillary carcinoma.  However  the possibility of invasive papillary carcinoma cannot be completely excluded due to the fragmented nature of this small needle biopsy.  The final classification of this papillary carcinoma is best performed after evaluation of the entire tumor following an excisional specimen.  Sections are stained for estrogen and progesterone receptors by an immunohistochemical technique and HER-2/neu by FISH.  The proliferation rate is determined with an immunohistochemical stain for mib-1.

Two additional foci are located in the lower inner quadrant  and measure respectively 0.9 and 0.5 cm in greatest dimension.  Histologically all the tumor foci are morphologically similar and appear also associated with a component of high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ.  The closest margin for the invasive carcinoma appears to be the inferior  with tumor extending to within 1.8 mm from the cauterized excision margin (section C7).  Ductal carcinoma in situ also approximates the inferior margin  with DCIS extending to approximately  1 mm from it (section C9).

Fragments of papillary carcinoma  see commentCOMMENT:  The biopsy demonstrate the presence of a well differentiated ductal proliferation demonstrating a cribriform and a papillary pattern of growth and focally  showing an expansile periphery. The performed immunohistochemical stains demonstrate that the neoplastic elements are negative for CK903 and CK5/6 and lack  in the performed stains for P63 and SMMHC  evidence of a myoepithelial layer. The differential raised by these findings includes a papillary ductal carcinoma in situ  an encapsulated (intracystic) papillary carcinoma and an invasive papillary carcinoma.  A definitive distinction between these possibilities as well as a definitive assessment of the possible invasiveness of the lesion is difficult in this core biopsy material  although note is made of the lack of expression of myoepithelial markers and of of the focally expansile periphery of the neoplasia. Case seen in consultation with Dr. M. Martel  who concurs.Sections are stained for estrogen and progesterone receptors by an immunohistochemical technique and HER-2/neu by FISH.  The proliferation rate is determined with an immunohistochemical stain for mib-1.  The results are as follows:Estrogen Receptor:  positive (100%)Progesterone Receptor:  positive (approximately 70%)Ki-67 Proliferation Rate:  low (approximately 10%)HER-2/neu by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH):  pendingCOMMENT:  Performance of the immunologic reagents utilized in the above report have been characterized by Providence Portland Medical Center.

High-grade infiltrating ductal carcinoma and high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ was reported to have been present in the 8:00 right breast needle core biopsy specimen; a microscopic tumor embolus was reported to be present in a lymphatic channel in the 10:30 right breast needle core biopsy specimen.  Reviewing the patient's clinical history in Physician Portal  the patient is reported to have subsequently undergone.neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In the current simple mastectomy specimen  one clip is present in the upper-outer quadrant and a second clip is present the lower-outer quadrant.  Sections of the upper-outer quadrant and lower-outer quadrant show slight fibrosis  focal mild chronic inflammation and rare foreign body giant cells but no residual carcinoma is identified in these sections or in any of the breast tissue submitted.  No gross lesions are identified in the specimen.  Based on this clinical history  the lack of identifiable residual carcinoma is attributed to response to pre-operative chemotherapy.

In slides C8 and C12  three areas showing single neoplastic cells in the adjacent surrounding stroma are present  consistent with foci of microinvasion (less than 1mm). The interpretation of the immunostains for myoepithelial cells performed (p63 and SMMHC) is difficult since these areas consist of single cells and are mostly not identifiable in the immunostained sections. Keratin immunostain shows positivity in single cells in the surrounding stroma  finding that would support the presence of microinvasion.
