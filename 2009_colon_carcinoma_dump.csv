Detached clusters of atypical highly dysplastic colonic glands suspicious for invasive colonic adenocarcinoma  see comment.  COMMENT:  The biopsy material consists predominantly of normal colonic mucosa lacking adenomatous dysplasia or evidence of carcinoma.  Note is made however of detached minute fragments of highly dysplastic colonic glandular structures characterized by a focal cribriform pattern of growth and by marked cytologic atypia.  The latter appear  in conjunction with the clinical impression of a colonic mass   to be highly suspicious for the presence of a  colonic adenocarcinoma  although the detached nature and lack of association with a desmoplastic stroma preclude a more definitive interpretation.  Of note   the submitted tissue has been exhausted after the examination of multiple H&E  sections in an attempt to identify a frankly invasive component.  Case seen in consultation with Dr. Yaping Wu  who concurs with the above interpretation.

Fibroconnective tissue with chronic inflammation and abundant mucin without evidence of epithelial component.Comment:  The findings of extensive mucin with an associated low-grade mucinous epithelial component are consistent with the diagnosis of pseudomyxoma peritonei.  Pseudomyxoma peritonei  an entity characterized by grossly evident diffuse intra-abdominal mucin associated with low-grade mucinous tumor implants  is in most cases the result of a mucinous neoplasm arising in the appendix.  In this case  there is involvement of the appendix with intra-abdominal dissemination with ovarian involvement  therefore  the findings are consistent with a primary appendiceal neoplasm with dissemination into the abdominal cavity and ovary.  The classification and nomenclature used for appendiceal mucinous neoplasms is controversial.  Some authors would classify a tumor with low-grade cytology  but spreading through the appendiceal wall and invading other organs  including the ovary  enough evidence to designate the neoplasm as an adenocarcinoma.  However  more recent classifications have used the terms appendiceal neoplasm of low malignant potential (Pie  K. and Longacre  T.  Adv Anat Pathol  2005; 12:291-311) and low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm with peritoneal spread (Misdraji et al. Am J Surg Pathol 2003 Aug;27(8):1089-103)  referring to tumors with low-grade cytology lacking features of high-grade histology or clearly destructive invasion  like in this case. Regardless of the terminology used  cases like this  where the epithelium is characterized by low-grade features and absence of frank features of adenocarcinoma  should be distinguished from tumors presenting as diffuse carcinomatosis known behave in a more aggressive fashion. Low-grade mucinous neoplasm that present with mucin and associated epithelium have been regarded as low grade with high risk of recurrence and the biologic potential for these tumors appears to be a high risk for intra-abdominal recurrence with little or no risk of extra-abdominal distant metastasis (Am J Surg Pathol  2009; 33:1425-1439).This case was reviewed at the Daily Intradepartmental QA Conference.

One tissue fragment is glandular mucosa that again shows regenerative change with loss of cytoplasmic mucin and increased numbers of mucosal chronic inflammatory cells.  B)  BIOPSY  DUODENUM:  Sections demonstrate duodenal mucosa characterized by the presence of multiple foci of invasive  moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  The neoplasm is composed of irregular duct-like structures whose constituent nuclei are large  polygonal  hyperchromatic and pleomorphic.  These have coarse chromatin  inconspicuous nucleoli  and there is a variable amount of acidophilic cytoplasm.  The neoplasm is evaluated with a limited panel of monoclonal antibodies.  The invasive carcinoma strongly expresses cytokeratin-7  while the normal duodenal mucosa is negative with this antibody.  The neoplasm is also positive for cytokeratin-20 and it strongly expresses villin.  CD19-9  which is a marker of upper gastrointestinal tumors  is positive  while cdx-2 which marks tumor of the colon is negative with regard to the neoplasm.

The segment of colon has an approximate length of 35 cm and diameter that varies from 2-3 cm.  The margin having the larger diameter is presumed to be proximal.  The serosa reveals abundant fibrous adhesions creating tortuous kinks and stapled margins of resection.  Soft tissue is adherent to the presumed distal aspect of the specimen.  A portion of colon is opened to reveal average wall thickness of 0.4 cm.  Most closely approximating the presumed proximal margin by 3 cm is a 0.7 cm sessile polyp which is sectioned to reveal no grossly recognizable evidence of wall involvement.  The polyp is entirely submitted.  Most closely approximating the presumed proximal margin of resection by 14 cm is a 6.5 cm region of white-tan discoloration suspicious for an adherent exudate.  Most closely approximating the presumed proximal margin by 21 cm  the presumed distal margin by 11 cm and the nearest vascular margin by 6.5 cm is a 5 x 4.5 cm coarsely granular exophytic tumor which is sectioned to reveal the maximum radial thickness of 1.5 cm.  The tumor appears not to involve the colonic wall.  Sections of the tumor are embedded for frozen section diagnosis; the remainder of the tumor is submitted in its entirety.  The two separately received piece of tissue corresponding to the stoma are a piece of intestinal tissue having a length of 1.5 cm and diameter of 3.5 cm and an irregular piece of yellow-tan tumor measuring 4.5 cm in greatest dimension.  The piece of intestinal tissue reveals a surgically stapled margin of resection and unremarkable cut surfaces.  The piece of yellow-tan tissue reveals an adherent piece of presumed skin measuring 1.5 cm in greatest dimension and cut surfaces that vary from fatty to fibrotic.  Representative sections of the stoma are submitted in addition to representative sections of the portion of intestinal tissue.  FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:  A)  COLON:  TUBULAR ADENOMA; NO ADENOCARCINOMA IS NOTED ON SAMPLED TISSUE. (YW) NOTE:  The specimen was put in formalin for 5 to 10 minutes before frozen sectioning  therefore the histology on the surface is not well preserved on frozen sections  preventing the evaluation of high grade dysplasia.

B)  SMALL BOWEL:  Received in formalin labeled Green  Lyal Lee is a non-oriented piece of small intestinal tissue having the approximate length of 5 cm and diameter of 3 cm.  The serosa reveals central surgical sutures transversely oriented across the antimesenteric aspect of the specimen.  Both margins are surgically stapled.  The wall averages 0.3 cm in thickness and the mucosa is mildly hyperemic at the site of the surgical sutures  with no pathologic changes noted grossly.  Representative sections are submitted.  SECTIONS:B1)  B2)  en face margins;B3)  B4)  representative central.  C)  COLON:  Received fresh labeled Green  Lyal Lee is a non-oriented 7 cm length of intestinal tissue having average diameter of 3 cm.  The serosa reveals surgically stapled margins of resection.  The wall measures up to 0.5 cm in thickness and the mucosa reveals no grossly recognizable lesions or abnormalities.  Representative sections are submitted.

Per Dr. Shia at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and Dr. Wang at UCLA  rare colon cancer  especially in the cecal area  may have the pattern of CK7 positive  CK20 negative/positive and cdx-2 negative  similar to the immunoprofile of small bowel adenocarcinoma.  Based on this information and both of the tumor with similar morphology and immunoprofile  This tumor in the cecum probably  is the primary site and it may  have metastasized to the sigmoid area.  Therefore  I have staged this tumor as primary colorectal carcinoma with matastasis to sigmoid area (M1).Pathology Staging Summary:*Specimen type:  Total colectomy*Tumor site:  Cecum and sigmoid colon*Tumor size:  6 cm and 5 cm*Histologic type:  Adenocarcinoma*Invasion of: *Submucosa:  Yes *Muscularis propria:  Yes *Subserosa/pericolonic/perirectal tissue:  Yes*Perforation of visceral peritoneum  invasion of other organs/structures:  Yes (from cecum to sigmoid)*Total regional lymph nodes:  22     *Number positive:  7*Grade:  Poorly differentiated*Lymphatic invasion:  Yes*Large vessel invasion:  No*MARGINS:*Radial margin:  Negative*Proximal margin:  Negative*Distal margin:  Negative*AJCC Pathologic Stage:  T3 N2 M1 (see above comment)

Metastatic adenocarcinoma with intestinal-like histologic features (see microscopic description and comment).COMMENT: The metastatic adenocarcinoma in this case has intestinal-like features with cytoplasmic goblet cell appearance in some areas. Strongly positive CK7 staining with weaker CK20 staining can be seen in adenocarcinomas of the upper gastrointestinal tract and this pattern would argue against a colonic primary source; however  appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinomas can show a higher proportion of CK7 positivity and less prominent CK20 staining and these tumors tend to show a brush border pattern on villin stain  as was seen here. Strongly positive CDX2 staining is also typical with gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas. Upper GI sources to rule out would include esophagus and stomach; pancreatic adenocarcinomas usually show cytoplasmic staining with villin  rather than the brush border pattern seen here  and the pancreas is described as normal on the patient's recent abdominal CT report of 9/20/2009. This histologic pattern and CK7/CK20 profile can also be seen in mucinous carcinomas of ovarian origin. Positive CDX2 staining can also be seen with mucinous ovarian carcinomas. However  ovarian mucinous carcinomas tend to show cytoplasmic staining without brush border reactivity with villin. Also  no ovarian masses are described in the recent pelvic CT report of 9/20/2009. This CK7/CK20 pattern can also be seen in carcinomas of breast ductal origin; however  this intestinal-like morphology would be unusual for a breast carcinoma and the absence of staining for estrogen receptor  BRST-2 and mammaglobin do not lend support for a breast primary. Given the presence of a large mass in the right lung with invasion into the hilum and mediastinum described on the chest CT of 9/20/2009  an enteric (intestinal-like) adenocarcinoma of primary lung origin would be in the differential  as these can show a CK7 positive/ CK20 positive profile with positive CDX2 staining and can closely imitate gastrointestinal primary adenocarcinomas in metastatic sites.In summary  in this metastatic adenocarcinoma with intestinal-like histologic features  primary origin from upper gastrointestinal sources such as esophagus and stomach would need to be ruled out on a clinincal basis. A pancreatic primary source appears unlikely based on the negative radiologic imaging impression. An appendical primary source would need to be excluded on a clinical basis but primary sources from elsewhere in the colon have been ruled out based on these findings. A mucinous ovarian primary source appears unlikely based on the findings here as well as on the negative radiologic imaging impression. An enteric (intestinal-like) adenocarcinoma of primary lung origin is in the differential based on the pathologic findings and the presence of a large lung mass; however  the other gastrointestinal primary sources listed above must first be excluded clinically.

In the previous cervical biopsy the tumor shows a solid growth pattern morphologically consistent with squamous cell carcinoma  without evidence of glandular differentiation. The minor areas of  solid pattern in the current specimen are similar to the biopsy and could indicate squamous differentiation  therefore the tumor could represent an adenosquamous carcinoma  in the current specimen characterized by the glandular component.

Proximal and distal surgical margins of resection  uninvolved by dysplasia or malignancy.5.  Radial margin  uninvolved by malignancy.6.  Fifteen regional lymph nodes  negative for malignancy (0/15).COMMENT:  In the part B specimen  the main mass consists of colonic adenocarcinoma invading into the subserosal soft tissue with involvement of the inked serosal surface.  In addition  a focus of poorly differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma is seen separate from this mass  involving the soft tissue just beneath the serosal surface only.  This focus is interpreted to represent origin from adenocarcinoma in the colon outside of this immediate region and is therefore classified as a T4 component to the tumor.  The tumor in the subserosal soft tissue component does not show features of well-circumscribed nodular architecture or histologic features of residual lymph node architecture and the fifteen lymph nodes that are identified are uninvolved by malignancy.  Based on these findings  the lymph node stage is classified as N0.  The presence of poorly differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma in the part A omental biopsy without evidence of residual lymph node architecture is classified as an M1 component of the tumor.  The overall stage is therefore classified as T4  N0  M1. Representative sections of Parts A and B are also reviewed by Xiaohong Cai  M.D.  Ph.D.  gastrointestinal pathologist in our group  who concurs with this overall staging classification.Pathology Staging Summary:*Specimen type:  Sigmoid colon  segmental resection*Tumor site:  Sigmoid*Tumor size:  5.2 x 5.0 x 2.5 cm*Histologic type:  Colonic adenocarcinoma*Invasion of: *Submucosa:  Yes *Muscularis propria:  Yes *Subserosa/pericolonic/perirectal tissue:  Yes*Perforation of visceral peritoneum  invasion of other organs/structures:  Yes*Total regional lymph nodes:  15     *Number positive:  0*Grade:  Moderately to poorly differentiated*Lymphatic invasion:  Not identified*Large vessel invasion:  Not identified*MARGINS:*Radial margin:  Uninvolved by malignancy*Proximal margin:  Uninvolved by dysplasia or malignancy*Distal margin:  Uninvolved by dysplasia or malignancy*Distance of tumor from closest margin:  9 mm*Specify margin:  Radial*AJCC Pathologic Stage:  T4  N0  M1 (see comment above)

The neoplasm is characterized by small acinar clusters of malignant cells that display irregular  ovoid  hyperchromatic nuclei and a variable amount of eosinophilic vacuolated cytoplasm.  It is obvious that there is abundant intracytoplasmic and extracellular mucin.  Also present on the slides are fragments of a tubulovillous adenoma.  The neoplasm appears to be definitely invasive.The neoplasm is evaluated with a limited panel of monoclonal antibodies.  The tumor cells strongly express cytokeratin 20  while they are focally positive for cytokeratin 7.  The neoplasm strongly expresses cdx-2 which is a marker of lower gastrointestinal tract carcinoma and it is also positive for villin.Signet ring cell carcinomas can be primary in the colon or metastatic.  Since fragments of a tubulovillous adenoma are present it seems logical to assume that this is a primary neoplasm and the immunophenotype is consistent with a colonic primary. The patient previously had a carcinoma of the right colon SP03-9076  dated 5/22/2003.  That neoplasm was described by me as a typical  moderately differentiated infiltrating adenocarcinoma.  It seems likely that the current signet ring carcinoma is a second primary.

Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma focally involving the biopsy tissue with extension to the pleural surface  and angiolymphatic invasion (see microscopic description).2.  The non-neoplastic pulmonary tissue shows chronic interstitial inflammation with type II cell hyperplasia and focal fibrosis.COMMENT:  The morphologic findings are those of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma nearly totally involving the right lower lobe wedge biopsy (part A)  and partially involving the right middle lobe wedge biopsy (part B) with pleural invasion and angiolymphatic invasion noted in the part B.  The non-neoplastic pulmonary tissue of the right middle lobe wedge biopsy shows chronic inflammation  type II cell hyperplasia and focal fibrosis.  To characterize the nature of the carcinoma  a panel of immunostains was performed on tissue block A2.  The stains show the carcinoma cells to be positive for keratin AE1/AE3 and keratin 7  but negative for keratin 20  TTF-1  CDx-2  BRST-2  ER  hepatocyte  thyroglobulin  synaptophysin  chromogranin and calcitonin.  The immunohistochemical results may rule out the possibility of metastatic adenocarcinoma from colon  breast  liver  thyroid (including calcitonin producing medullary carcinoma)  but do not exclude the possibility of metastatic adenocarcinoma from upper GI  biliary  pancreas and other sites.  Furthermore  the negativity of TTF-1 neither supports nor completely excludes the possibility of adenocarcinoma of pulmonary primary.  Therefore  clinical and radiographic correlation is recommended for complete interpretation.Intradepartmental consultation was performed by Drs. Sidney Rosenheim and Chris Cai  who concur with the above diagnoses and interpretation.

The tumor grows as cords and nodules in a reactive fibrous stroma.  The malignant cells have irregular  ovoid nuclei that are diffusely hyperchromatic.  They have medium  coarse chromatin  small nucleoli and thin nuclear membranes.  They generally have a high N:C ratio with a scant amount of basophilic cytoplasm.  Apoptotic cells are present and numerous mitotic figures are seen.  Foci of necrosis are evident.  Gland formation is inconspicuous.B)  NODULE (CHEST WALL):  Sections demonstrate metastatic carcinoma involving the chest wall.  A small amount of skeletal muscle is present subjacent to the neoplasm.  In these sections the tumor has a more noticeable glandular pattern and is consistent with a primary in the colon.  There is extensive dirty necrosis.  The margin is positive.C)  CHEST WALL NODULE:  A large nodule of metastatic  moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma as described is present.  Neoplasm appears to extend to the perimeter of the excision  where cauterized neoplasm is present.D)  GALLBLADDER:  A section of gallbladder demonstrates intact mucosa with no evidence of neoplasm involving the organ.  A lymph node present on the slide shows numerous lipid granulomata  but no metastatic carcinoma.E)  RIGHT LIVER LOBECTOMY:  Slides E1 and E2 demonstrate a subcapsular nodule of metastatic  moderately to poorly differentiated carcinoma as described.  This does not involve a surgical margin.  The largest nodule on E3 elevates the capsule and is characterized by very extensive necrosis.  Large zones of necrotic tumor are included on E4 and E5  along with additional nodules of viable carcinoma.E6 contains the smallest neoplastic nodule  and again this is moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  A large nodule of completely necrotic carcinoma is included on this same slide.Slide E7 contains hepatic tissue with a nodule of necrotic neoplasm  but no viable carcinoma is present on this slide.  On E8 tumor is evident in adhesions to the capsular surface of the liver.  Some of this may be intravascular.

This ultrasound report describes the appearance of a T3  N1 rectal cancer which was marked with India ink.  Since that time  the patient is reported to have undergone chemo/radiation therapy  reportedly completed approximately six weeks ago.  Sections of the entirely submitted ulcerated lesion in the gross specimen show luminal ulceration with adenomatous change in the residual luminal epithelium.  Features of high grade dysplasia or invasive malignancy are not identified in the sections of the entirely submitted ulcerated lesion.  No prior biopsy from this site is found in the Providence System files.  Based on this  the tumor stage classification would rely on clinical and radiologic findings.  One of thirty-three lymph nodes in the resection specimen does show evidence of metastatic adenocarcinoma and the lymph node stage would be classified as N1 based on this.CONSULTATION:   Xiaohong Cai  M.D.  Ph.D.  Gastrointestinal Pathologist (slides A12 and A15 through A21)

The ileal tissues are uninflamed and show no mucosal abnormalities.  The colonic tissues at the distal surgical show extensive mucosal erosion and ulceration with dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the mucosal lamina propria and some adjacent portions of the submucosa.  A small remnant of glandular mucosa  which is peripherally undermined by a mucosal fissure  contains irregularly enlarged and distorted crypts without evident cryptitis or dysplasia.  Section A3 contains longitudinal and cross-sections of the uninflamed vermiform appendix showing no glandular epithelial dysplasia.  Section A4 contains full-thickness pieces of intestinal wall mucosa at the ileocecal valve showing no active colitis or dysplasia.  Sections A5 through A13 contain full-thickness pieces of colonic wall and mucosa with progressively severe active colitis proceeding distally  The mucosal surfaces are extensively eroded or ulcerated and fissured with formation of inflammatory pseudopolyps having variably enlarged and distorted crypts exhibiting foci of active cryptitis and crypt abscess formation.  The glandular epithelium shows numerous areas of reactive hyperchromasia and mucous depletion  but is not apparently dysplastic.  The grossly described sessile polyp in section A5 is a relatively large inflammatory pseudopolyp showing no glandular epithelial dysplasia.  The remaining mucosal tissues are also negative for dysplasia or invasive colonic adenocarcinoma. A few uninflamed submucosal diverticula are noted in the proximal portion of the colon.  Section A14 contains four lymph nodes showing slight to moderate reactive sinus histiocytosis  but no focal inflammatory lesions or tumor metastases are identified.

Colonic adenocarcinoma  poorly differentiated  infiltrating through the muscularis propria into the pericolic adipose tissue; see comment and staging summary.  COMMENT:  Sections of specimen C demonstrate the presence of a poorly differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma  infiltrating through the muscularis propria into the pericolic adipose tissue (demonstrated on section C17). The tumor involves the appendiceal orifice and extends up into the appendix.   Lymphovascular invasion is focally identified (section C15).  Of note   involvement of the visceral serosa is not seen.  The bladder mucosa shows the presence of severe acute and chronic inflammation  consistent with cystitis. Immunohistochemical stains for CK20 and p53 fail to demonstrate evidence of significantly increased positivity in the urothelial epithelium.  These findings are compatible with the morphologic impression of cystitis and show no diagnostic evidence of urothelial dysplasia. Despite the presence of adhesions  definitive evidence of involvement of bladder wall by the colonic carcinoma could not be identified in the examined sections.  A submucosal lipoma is identified at the level of the ileocecal valve (section C8).  Tubulovillous adenomas are present in the resected segment of colonic wall  one of which shows consistent with the presence of a small component of invasive carcinoma  demonstrating evidence of infiltration of the submucosa (sections C39 and C40).  Of note  features diagnostic of invasion are not identified in the remaining multiple adenomatous colonic polyps.  Fifty-one pericolonic lymph nodes were identified and all appear negative for carcinoma (0/51).D)  SKIN  ABDOMINAL WALL LESION  BIOPSY: 1.  Seborrheic keratosis.

The tumor cells show high N:C ratios  eosinophilic cytoplasm  nuclei which vary moderately in size and shape and exhibit prominent nucleoli and numerous atypical mitotic figures.  The tumor is ulcerated on the surface and extends deep into the wall to the subserosa  however the tumor is surrounded by extensive acute and chronic inflammation with foreign body type giant cells that extend up to the deep inked margin and possibly represent a previous perforation site that caused the tumor to be adhesed to itself.  The sections that represent areas of adhesion did not show malignant cells  rather than an extensive inflammatory process.The uninvolved adjacent colonic mucosa shows melanosis coli.

Extensive involvement by poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet-ring-type cells  favor metastasis from gastrointestinal primary (see comment).COMMENT:  There is extensive involvement by poorly differentiated carcinoma with signet ring type cells.  The immunohistochemical profile and overall morphologic features are most consistent with a metastasis from a gastrointestinal primary  including stomach  colon  pancreas and appendix.  Considering the intraoperative findings of a mass in the gastric area  a gastric primary would be favored.
