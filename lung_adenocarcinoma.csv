LUNG  LEFT UPPER LOBE  BIOPSY: 1.  Invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (see comment). Comment:  The findings are diagnostic of an invasive adenocarcinoma.  Immunohistochemical stains were performed  and show that the tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin 7  and negative for TTF-1 and cytokeratin 20.  While TTF-1 negativity is uncommon in pulmonary adenocarcinoma  the absence of TTF-1 staining does not exclude a lung primary.  A breast adenocarcinoma may also show this immunophenotype.  Clinical and radiographic correlation are necessary.

20 GAUGE LEFT LUNG MASS CORES:1.  Adenocarcinoma.COMMENT:  The findings are similar to those seen in a previous bone marrow biopsy  SV-10-8000.  As determined in the previous work-up with a battery of immunostains  the differential includes primary adenocarcinoma of the lung  and  metastasis from upper GI sites (biliary  pancteatic  gastric)  endocervix  or ovary.  In this setting primary adenocarcinoma of the lung seems most likely.

LUNG  RIGHT HILUM  ENDOSCOPIC BRONCHOSCOPIC ULTRASOUND-GUIDED FNA  CYTOLOGY:1.  Positive for malignant cells  consistent with an adenocarcinoma.Comment:  Given the patient's stated clinical history  this likely represents pulmonary origin. If immunohistochemical studies are needed  they can be requested by the clinical services and the cell block material should be adequate for those studies. Correlation with clinical  bronchoscopic and radiographic findings is suggested.  Please correlate with NP10-2016.  This case was reviewed at the Daily Intradepartmental QA Conference.

MEDIASTINAL LYMPH NODE; FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION (SUBMITTED OUTSIDE CELL BLOCK  AND SMEARS; CYT-10-2803):1.  Positive for cytologically malignant cells.2.  Lung adenocarcinoma.COMMENT:  Ten submitted unstained slides represent a cell block from fine needle aspiration performed on a mediastinal lymph node.  One slide is stained with H&E and shows large cohesive cells with marked eosinophilic and dense cytoplasm and markedly pleomorphic  vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli. The tumor cells have a prominent epidermoid contour  but no definite squamous differentiation is identified. The background shows mostly blood elements including neutrophils. There are insufficient lymphoid component and absent germinal follicles to confirm the lymph node origin.An additional four direct smears and one concentrated SurePath slide are received on 5/27/10.  The slides are moderately cellular and show clusters of markedly atypical cells with moderate nuclear pleomorphism  prominent nuclear overlapping and grooving.  The features are consistent with adenocarcinoma.Immunohistochemical stains along with appropriate controls are performed on the cell block and show the tumor cells to be positive for  TTF-1 and CK7   while being  negative for CK5/6 and CK20.  This immunoprofile is in support of a lung primary.  This is essentially in agreement with the outside report.

RIGHT NECK MASS  NEEDLE CORE BIOPSY:1.   Metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma carcinoma with basaloid/squamoid features (see comment).COMMENT:  Sections demonstrate four cores of fibrous tissue diffusely infiltrated by small nests or cords of poorly differentiated carcinoma cells with desmoplastic reaction.  The neoplastic cells have basaloid appearance displaying large oval to irregular nuclear contours  hyperchromatin  conspicuous and inconspicuous nucleoli and scanty to moderate cytoplasm.  No keratinization is present. Nuclear molding or tumor necrosis is not seen.   No glandular or neuroendocrine differentiation is identified.  The morphologic findings are those of a poorly differentiated carcinoma with basaloid/squamoid features.  The immunostains show the neoplastic cells to be positive for keratin 7  p63  p16 and high molecular keratin 903  and weakly positive for CD138  but negative for keratin 5/6  keratin 20  villin  CEA-m  CD56  TTF-1  ER  mammaglobulin  desmin  and WT-1.  The immunoprofile argues against metastatic adenocarcinoma of pulmonary origin due to the negativity of villin  CEA and TTF-1.  The negativity of CD56 rules out the possibility of a metastatic neuroendocrine tumor.  The negativity of ER and mammaglobulin argues against the possibility of metastatic carcinoma of breast origin.  The negativity of villin and CEA-m does not support the possibility of poorly differentiated metastatic adenocarcinoma of upper GI or pancreas origin.Overall   the morphologic and immunohistochemical findings are most consistent with metastatic poorly differentiated basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of possible head and neck origin  but the possibility of metastatic carcinoma with basaloid/squamoid features from lung or other sites cannot be completely excluded.  Clinical and radiographic correlation is necessary for complete interpretation.This case was also reviewed by Dr. Jian Shen  who concurs with the interpretation.
RIGHT BUTTOCK:1.  Adenocarcinoma with ciliated cells. COMMENT:  The case is discussed with Dr. Lewis-Traylor by telephone.  The patient has an interesting history.  She was one of a pair of conjoined twins  and the sacral site where this tumor appeared contains scar from the procedure performed to separate the two.  The other twin did not survive.  A fungating mass arose at this site during the past four months  with some bleeding.  The patient has abnormalities on imaging indicating destruction of the sacral bone and possible other sites of involvement in the pelvis  and there are some neurologic symptoms of the lower extremities.The lesion appears as metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary.  The immunostaining pattern favors origin from breast  lung  ovary  pancreas  mesothelium  endometrium  or urothelium  and militates against a lower GI source.  Given the history and location  the possibility of malignant transformation of a sacrococcygeal teratoma is also a consideration.  Further work up is needed to characterize this unusual lesion.
BONE MARROW  LEFT HIP  BIOPSY:1.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma (see comment).COMMENT:  Histologic sections demonstrate trabecular bone and bone marrow which is diffusely infiltrated by sheets of neoplastic glands with focal mucin production.  The neoplastic cells show increased N:C ratio  open chromatin  prominent nucleoli  moderate to scanty cytoplasm  and increased mitoses. The bone marrow in the involved areas shows dense fibrosis.  No normal hematopoietic cellular elements are noted.  The morphologic findings are consistent with those of a metastatic adenocarcinoma. Immunostains show the adenocarcinoma to be positive for keratin 7  villin  CEA-m and CD19  with increased Ki-67 proliferative rate  but negative for keratin 20  cdx-2  TTF-1  ER  PR  mammoglobin  p16  p53 and WT-1.  The immunohistochemical findings basically rule out the possibility of metastatic adenocarcinoma from colorectal origin due to the negativity of keratin 20 and Cdx-2  and do not support metastatic adenocarcinoma from breast origin either  due to the negativity of ER  PR and mammoglobin.  Based on this immunoprofile  the possible primary sites for a metastatic adenocarcinoma may include  but not limit to  upper GI including cholangiocarcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma due to the positivity of villin  CD19 and CEA-m  and endocervical and ovarian adenocarcinoma.   In review of the patient's clinical history  the patient also has a concurrent mass in the lung  which may represent either lung primary tumor or metastatic adenocarcinoma to lung.  However  the current immunostains neither support nor completely exclude the possibility of metastatic adenocarcinoma of pulmonary origin due to the positivity of keratin 7 and the negativity of TTF-1.   Therefore  clinical and radiographic correlation is necessary for complete interpretation.Intradepartmental consultation was performed by Dr. Chris Cai  GI Pathologist  who concurs with the interpretation.

Per outside pathology report (slides not available for review)  immunohistochemical stains performed at PhenoPath Laboratories are reported as follows:Cytokeratin 7:  Uniformly positiveTTF-1:  Focally positiveEstrogen receptor:  Variably positivePR:  NegativeHer-2/neu by IHC:  Equivocal (2+) and negative for Her-2 gene amplification by FISH.Mammaglobin  GCDFP-15  PAX-5  villin  CDX-2  cytokeratin 20 and napsin A protein are all reported negative.COMMENT:  Thank you for allowing us to review this case.  The breast core biopsy from 2000  shows an invasive ductal carcinoma  grade 2 and measuring 0.9 cm in the largest area in this core biopsy (there was no residual carcinoma in the subsequent mastectomy specimen  Legacy Laboratory Services SM00-6279) and all axillary lymph nodes removed at the time of surgery were negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/10).  By clinical history  the patient now presents with a lung mass  hilar and mediastinal adenopathy  osseous metastatic lesions and innumerable subcutaneous nodules in the trunk  upper arms and thighs.Although the breast and metastatic carcinoma in the soft tissue show morphologic similarities  in the current metastatic carcinoma the cells show slightly more nuclear atypicality  however  morphologically this metastasis could be compatible with the previous breast carcinoma.  Immunohistochemically  by report (the slides are not reviewed) the breast carcinoma in 2000 was reported as strongly positive for ER and PR  and negative for Her-2; and the current tumor in the soft tissue is reported as variably positive for ER  negative for PR and showed focal positivity for TTF-1.  Other markers that can be expressed in breast carcinoma such as mammaglobin and GCDFP-15 were negative.  It's noted in the PhenoPath report  that in a recent study presented at the USCAP meeting in March 2010 performed at PhenoPath Laboratories  a small percentage of breast cancers can show expression for TTF-1 (a marker usually positive if lung and thyroid).  However  lung carcinomas which often express TTF-1 can occasionally show positivity for estrogen receptor.Therefore  although morphologically and immunohistochemically the findings of the current soft tissue metastatic adenocarcinoma could be compatible with metastatic breast carcinoma  it cannot be completely excluded that it represents a metastasis from a new lung primary tumor.

The previous history of breast carcinoma is noted.  Immunohistochemical stains along with appropriate controls are performed and show the tumor cells to be  positive for CK-7 and TTF-1 with rare positive cells for CK20 while being negative for ER  PR  BRST-2 and for thyroglobulin.  This immunoprofile along with histologic features are in support of lung primary.  Special stains are reviewed in consultation with Dr. Margret Othinger.
A) AND B)  TUMOR AND RIGHT CEREBELLAR TUMOR:  Sections reveal large fragments of metastatic epithelioid neoplasm with increased NC ratio and nuclear hyperchromasia as well as nuclear pleomorphism and prominent nucleoli. immunostains revealed that tumor cells are positive for CK7 and TTF1 and negative for CK20 and GFAP  consistent with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of lung primary.
LUNG  LEFT; NEEDLE CORE BIOPSIES:1.  Invasive  moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.
LIVER MASS  18-GAUGE CORE BIOPSIES:1.  Metastatic  moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma  see comment.COMMENT:  Immunohistochemical studies are not specific  with the adenocarcinoma expressing only CK7 and CK19.  This immunoprofile would include upper gastrointestinal and pancreaticobiliary tract primaries in addition to breast and lung.  The immunohistochemical studies tend to exclude colorectal and hepatocellular origin as well as neuroendocrine differentiation.  Clinical and radiographic correlation recommended.
LUNG; NEEDLE CORE BIOPSIES:1.  Few atypical glands with cribriform pattern suspicious for non-small cell carcinoma  see comment.COMMENT:  This case had a  preliminary report as non-small cell carcinoma awaiting deeper sections and immunohistochemical studies.  The deeper sections fail to show more pathology and the tissue got exhausted.  The immunoprofile show the atypical cells to be strongly positive for CK7  CK20 with rare positive TTF1 and CK5/6.  This unusual immunoprofile will hold us from calling it non-small cell carcinoma.  A concurring second opinion in regard to these biopsies  is rendered by Dr. Jeffrey D. Harter.This patient  was discussed at Lung Cancer Clinic on Tuesday 4/27/2010   for which a complete review of previous biopsies SP10-8899 and NP10-1428 was performed.  On re-review of the left bronchial wash (NP10-1428) in particular   the sure path slide B1 is positive for non-small cell carcinoma consistent with adenocarcinoma.  Dr. June Olson reviewed all cases and agree with the diagnoses given.
LUNG; NEEDLE CORE BIOPSIES:1.  Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  COMMENT:  Immunohistochemical stains along with appropriate controls show the tumor cells diffusely positive for TTF1 and CK7 while being negative for CK20  CK5/6  and melanoma markers of Melan A  HMB45  S-100 and Tyrosinase.This immuno profile is in support of lung primary.
A)  SUBCARINAL LYMPH NODE  EBUS FNA:1.  Positive for malignant cells.2.

Furthermore  these cells are positive for CK7  TTF-1 (negative in background bronchial cells).  The stain for CK20 is negative.  These findings support the above diagnosis.B)  LEFT PRETRACHEAL LYMPH NODE  FNA:1.  Negative for malignant cells.2.  Polymorphous lymphocytes.

LUNG  RIGHT; NEEDLE CORE BIOPSIES:1.  Invasive poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma  cannot rule out spindle cell component.2.  Concurrent lung involvement by SLL/CLL (see comment).COMMENT:  Immunohistochemical stains along with appropriate controls are performed and show the tumor cells positive for AE1/AE3  CAM 5.2 and TTF-1  while being negative for vascular markers CD31 and CD34.  The keratins also show diffuse staining for a spindle cell component that could represent sarcomatoid carcinoma.  This immunoprofile is in support of lung primary and rules out metastasis from previous history of angiosarcoma.The atypical lymphoid infiltrate is evaluated with an immunohistochemical stain panel and shows abnormal CD20/CD5 coexpression with positive staining for bcl-2 and CD43  while showing negative staining for cyclin-D1  CD138  MUM-1  PAX-5  CD23 and bcl-6.  CD163 highlights the histiocytes.  CD3 shows a background of T-cells.  Bcl-6 shows marked background nonspecific staining.  Ki-67 nuclear proliferative activity is low  approximately 5%.This case was reviewed in consultation with Drs. Carlo Bifulco and Yaping Wu (Hematopathologists) and Dr. Melissa Li  who showed this case at the Intradepartmental Daily Conference in St. Vincent's Pathology Department.Results discussed with Dr. Kristen Cha at 11:00 a.m. on 4/26/2010.
PLEURAL FLUID:  Two direct smears  a SurePath concentration slide and cell block material are examined.  These demonstrate malignant cells present.  These cells are consistent with an adenocarcinoma.  Immunohistochemical stains are performed and evaluated on the cell block material with the appropriate controls.  The tumor cells are positive for CK7  p53  moderately positive for PR and weakly positive for ER.  The tumor cells are negative for TTF-1  CK20  mammaglobin and BRST-2.  The negative stains help to exclude lung and breast origins  while the positive stains are compatible with ovarian origin.  (sf)

COMMENT:  The exact classification of the neoplasm is contingent on the results of immunoperoxidase stains  which are pending.  Based on the H&E interpretation alone  this appears to be a poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma with no definite features of adenocarcinoma or squamous carcinoma. Less likely in the differential diagnosis is amelanotic malignant melanoma.

TISSUE FROM INCARCERATED EPIGASTRIC HERNIA REPAIR:  Section A1 contains pieces of fibrous and fibroadipose tissue with attached and detached fragments of a poorly differentiated epithelial neoplasm exhibiting multilayered groups of large atypical columnar  rounded and polygonal epithelial cells in solid and disorderly papillary arrangements with fibrovascular cores.  The cells have moderate amounts of non-vacuolated amphophilic cytoplasm and relatively large  irregularly rounded or ovoid nuclei with evenly dispersed chromatin  frequently prominent nucleoli and moderate numbers of atypical mitoses.  There are scattered areas of tumor necrosis.  The tumor cells show strongly positive nuclear immunostaining for estrogen receptor antigen frequently occurring in serous ovarian  breast and endometrial carcinomas  but not in mesothelioma.  The cells also show positive nuclear immunostaining for WT-1 antigen occurring in serous papillary and mesothelial carcinomas but not in breast or endometrial carcinomas.  The cells are positive for cytokeratin 7 usually present in all of these tumors  but are negative for cytokeratins 5/6  calretinin and D2-40 antigens often present in mesotheliomas.  The cells are positive for CA-125 occurring in most endometrial carcinomas  a  majority of serous ovarian carcinomas and in about 10% of breast carcinomas.  The tumor cells are positive for E-cadherin antigen occurring virtually all serous ovarian and ductal carcinomas of the breast  but in only about 5% of endometrial carcinomas.  The cells show positive nuclear immunostaining for p16 antigen occurring in about 70% of serous ovarian carcinomas and 25% of endometrial carcinomas  but not  in breast carcinomas.  The cells also show positive nuclear immunostaining for P53 antigen occurring in about 60% serous ovarian carcinomas and in 30% of breast and endometrial carcinomas.  The cells are negative for S-100 protein antigen occurring in a majority of serous ovarian and endometrial carcinomas and in about 30% of breast carcinomas.

LUNG  RIGHT LOWER LOBE; BIOPSIES:1.  Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma involving submitted biopsies.COMMENT:  Immunohistochemical stains along with appropriate controls are performed and show the tumor cells to be positive for CK7  TTF-1 and MOC31 and faintly positive for p63  while being negative for CK20 and CK5/6.  This immunoprofile is in support of lung primary.
FEMUR  RIGHT  CORE BIOPSY:1.  Involvement by a poorly differentiated carcinoma  most consistent with a non-small cell lung primary  see comment.2.  Negative for Hodgkin lymphoma.COMMENT:  The core biopsy material demonstrates the presence of minute nests of atypical epithelial elements characterized morphologically by an abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and pleomorphic atypical nuclei.  The performed immunohistochemical stains demonstrate that the neoplastic elements are positive for keratins AE1/AE3  cam 5.2 and for TTF-1 while failing to show definitive evidence of positivity for CD30  Pax-5  ER  PR  CD163 or S-100.  In summary  these morphological and immunophenotypical findings are diagnostic of involvement by a poorly differentiated carcinoma  and favor a lung adenocarcinoma as a possible primary.  Additional immunophenotypic studies  currently being performed  on the concurrent available FNA tissue block (NP-10-1286)  may contribute to this interpretation and will be reported in addendum.
RIGHT HILAR LYMPH NODE  EBUS:  The aspirate  presented on eleven direct smears and one SurePath slide  is cellular and reveals a population of pleomorphic cells with irregular nuclei  prominent nucleoli  and scant cytoplasm.  These cells are present either singly or in clusters.  Occasional intracytoplasmic vacuoles are also seen.  A population of polymorphous lymphocytes is present in the background  representing sampling from a lymph node.  The overall findings are consistent with metastatic non-small cell carcinoma to a lymph node  and morphologically favor adenocarcinoma.  The concurrent cell block specimen contains mostly blood and benign lymphocytes with rare tumor cells.  In conjunction with the clinical presentation  the morphological features are compatible with a lung primary.  A confirmatory stain for TTF-1 will be attempted on the cell block section  and the result will be reported in an addendum.  (JS/nm)

LUNG  BRONCHIAL WASHINGS (SUBMITTED SLIDES FPP-08-3532  SUREPATH AND CELL BLOCK):1.  Positive for cytologically malignant cells consistent with adenocarcinoma (see comment).COMMENT:  The submitted SurePath slide shows a mixture of columnar cells  squamous cells  macrophages and a few clusters of tightly grouped cells in a three-dimensional pattern.  The cell block reveals that these cells have eosinophilic cytoplasm and irregular  hyperchromatic nuclei showing glandular differentiation.  The submitted outside immunostains show the tumor cells positive for CK7 and rarely faintly positive for TTF-1  while being negative for CK20 and mammoglobin.  This immunoprofile is consistent with lung adenocarcinoma.

Non-diagnostic specimen (see microscopic description).C)  LYMPH NODE  SUBCARINAL REGION  FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION:1.  Adenocarcinoma (see microscopic description and comment).COMMENT:  It cannot be determined that a lymph node has been aspirated in any of the specimens  given the lack of a significant lymphoid cell population in the preparations.  The epithelial cells that are present in these preparations consist almost entirely of benign  occasionally reactive  columnar respiratory epithelial cells  which are interpreted to be obtained secondary to the approach to the aspirate target. However  a single small cluster of cytologically malignant epithelial cells with glandular differentiation is present in the cell block section of Part A. Several small clusters of cytologically malignant cells with glandular differentiation are present in the cell block section of the Part C specimen. Given the presence of bronchial cartilage and numerous columnar respiratory epithelial cells elsewhere in these cell block sections  these malignant fragments may have originated from the bronchus of the lung and it does not appear that a lymph node was aspirated  given the lack of a significant lymphoid cell population in the preparations.The findings above are discussed by telephone with the clinician  Dr. David Hotchkin  on February 10  2010.Additional TTF-1 immunohistochemical stains will be performed on the cell block material from both Parts A and C  as TTF-1 is a marker frequently associated with adenocarcinomas of lung origin. Results of these additional immunohistochemical stains will follow in an addendum report.
A)  RIGHT UPPER LOBE BRONCHIAL WASHINGS:  The cell block section contains a small loosely aggregated group of atypical cells with moderate amounts of non-vacuolated  nonkeratinized cytoplasm and relatively large  irregularly rounded or ovoid nuclei with thick nuclear membranes  prominent nucleoli and a few chromocenters.  Some cell nuclei are hyperchromatic.  No tubuloglandular structures are identified.  The cytospin smear contains numerous large atypical cells  many of which are necrotic with poor cytologic preservation.  There are a few better preserved cells with relatively large  irregularly rounded nuclei and indistinct nucleoli.  The direct smears also show extensive cellular necrosis with a few better preserved  large atypical cells resembling those present in the cell block section.  The atypical cells in the cell block sections show positive immunostaining for cytokeratin7 and focal weak immunostaining for Ber EP4 adenocarcinoma antigen.  The cells show negative immunostaining for TTF-1 antigen occurring in most adenocarcinomas of the lung and are negative for cytokeratins 5/6 characteristic of squamous carcinoma.  They are also negative for synaptophysin neuroendocrine tumor antigen..B)  BRONCHIAL BRUSHINGS:  The cell block section contains three small particles of fibrous tissue with groups of large  loosely cohesive atypical cells with varying amounts of nonvacuolated nonkeratinized cytoplasm and relatively large  irregularly rounded vesicular  occasionally hyperchromatic nuclei with variably increased nucleolar prominence and few additional chromocenters.  There is a relatively large amount of necrotic cellular material in the background.  The cytospin smear and direct smears also contain predominantly necrotic cellular material with numerous large cells showing poor cytologic preservation and a few better-preserved large atypical cells similar to those described in the cell block section.  The cells are distributed as discohesive individuals and in small disorderly clusters without tubuloglandular differentiation.  FDC:mgh
A)  LYMPH NODE  SUBCARINAL  BIOPSY:1.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma  favor lung primary  see commentB)  PANCREATIC TAIL BIOPSY:1.  Adenocarcinoma  favor metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinoma  see commentCOMMENT:  Section demonstrate the presence of a well differentiated adenocarcinoma. The performed immunohistochemical stains demonstrate that the neoplastic elements are positive for cytokeratin 7  TTF-1 and CEA  while appear negative for cdx-2  PSA  cytokeratin 20  WT-1  RCC and CA19.9.  These immunophenotypic findings appear most consistent with a possible lung primary neoplasm  although are not absolutely specific  and do not allow to unequivocally rule out other primary sites.  Correlation with the clinical findings is thus recommended. Case seen in consultation with Dr. S. Hussain  who concurs.

LUNG MASS  CORE BIOPSY:1.  Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung consistent with metastatic colon cancer (see comment). COMMENT:  The special stains will be performed on the tumor to confirm colonic origin  and results of these will be added to this report when available.
LEFT LOWER LUNG:  In slide A1  there are four biopsies  at least three of which have an invasive non-small cell carcinoma composed of minute solid small nests of large cells with high N:C ratios  small nucleoli  ill-defined pink cytoplasm  and associated with the ciliated respiratory columnar mucosa.  These nests are separated by some reactive fibrous stroma  consistent with an invasive component and are marginated by focal lymphocytic infiltrate.  In one of the smallest fragments  there are some rare intercellular bridges and some degenerative cells  consistent with squamous origin showing some pink  keratinized cytoplasm.  Adherent blood clot is noted.   A separate biopsy shows some normal respiratory ciliated columnar epithelial cells and underlying patchy lymphocytic infiltrate and some normal mucosal glands.  In slide A2  there are three additional hemorrhagic biopsies  two of which show additional foci of similar neoplasm.  RESULTS OF IMMUNOPEROXIDASE STAINS ON BLOCK A1:  The invasive neoplasm is strongly positive with cytokeratin 5/6  p63  and cytokeratin AE1/AE3 immunoperoxidase stains.  The control slides worked appropriately.  The tumor is negative with TTF-1  cytokeratin 7 and cytokeratin 20.  The results of the stains support the diagnosis of a squamous cell origin.  Primary squamous cell carcinomas of the lung are generally negative with TTF-1  unlike other carcinomas  such as adenocarcinoma.  Although most lung primaries are positive with cytokeratin 7 and negative with cytokeratin 20  negative results with both cytokeratins 7 and 20 do not exclude a lung primary.

The findings are suggestive of a lung primary. Recommend clinical and radiological correlation.
LUL LUNG MASS BIOPSY:1.  Non-small cell carcinoma.COMMENT:  Features favor poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.CONSULTATION:  Jeffrey D. Harter  M.D.
RIGHT PLEURAL FLUID  CYTOLOGY:1.  Positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma  consistent with lung primary.
BIOPSY OF LUNG MASS:  Sections demonstrate several core biopsies of a lung mass.  This is characterized by nodules of neoplastic cells that have irregularly ovoid nuclei that display diffuse hyperchromasia.  The nuclear chromatin is medium and nucleoli are generally small.  Cytoplasm is abundant and eosinophilic and mitotic figures are readily demonstrated.  The tumor is present in a sclerotic and chronically inflamed stroma.  The neoplasm is evaluated with a panel of monoclonal antibodies.  These demonstrate the neoplasm to be positive for keratin AE1/AE3 and negative for TTF-1  which is a marker of many pulmonary adenocarcinomas.  It is found to be negative for the melanoma markers melan-A and S-100 protein.  Thus  this is not a metastatic melanoma.Additional immunostains are performed to further evaluate the specimen.  The neoplasm is negative for cytokeratin 7 and cytokeratin 20.  It is also negative for CD56  which is neuroendocrine marker and for synaptophysin  another neuroendocrine marker.  It is also negative for MOC-31 which is an adenocarcinoma marker.  The neoplasm is negative for the mesothelioma markers WT-1  D2-40 and calretinin.  It is positive for p63 and cytokeratin 5/6 consistent with a squamous carcinoma.  The proliferation rate with mib-1 is moderate.
LUNG NODULES:1.  Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with the immunophenotype of a pulmonary adenocarcinoma.COMMENT:  A concurring second opinion has been rendered by Franklin D. Curl  M.D..
A)  SUBCARINAL LYMPH NODE:  The cell block section contains a small fragment of bronchial cartilage and numerous scattered clusters of atypical epithelial cells with small to abundant amounts of pale eosinophilic cytoplasm and relatively large rounded nuclei with thick nuclear membranes and prominent nucleoli.  The cells do not show cytoplasmic mucinous vacuoloization or keratinization.  They are loosely cohesive or discohesive and do not form tubuloglandular arrangements.  The direct smears and cytospin smear also contain numerous  large cytologically malignant cells arranged in disorderly groups and as discohesive individuals intermixed with pneumocytes and small to moderate numbers of acute and chronic inflammatory cells.  The tumor cells in the cell block sections show positive immunostaining for cytokeratins 5/6  cytokeratins AE1/AE3 and cytokeratin 7.  They show negative immunostaining for cytokeratin 20  Ber-EP4 adenocarcinoma antigen and for TTF-1 antigen occurring in most adenocarcinomas carcinomas of the lung.  The cells show focal  weakly positive immunostaining for D2-40 and negative immunostaining for calretinin and WT-1 antigens frequently occurring in mesothelioma.  This immunophenotype is consistent with metastatic  poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma (see comment)  B)  PRECARINAL LYMPH NODE:  The cell block section B1 contains loosely cohesive and discohesive large atypical cells similar to those described above.  The direct smears and cytospin smear also contain variable numbers of similarly atypical cells in a bloody background.  FDC:mgh

LUNG  LATERALITY UNSPECIFIED; BIOPSIES:1.  Moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma involving alveolated lung tissue fragments.
LUNG BIOPSY:  The submitted sections show multiple needle core biopsies representing an epithelioid and spindle cell neoplasm.  The epithelioid component is characterized by cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm  vesicular nuclei  mild hyperchromasia  nucleomegaly and few mitotic figures.  The spindle cell component is intimately admixed with the epithelioid component with elongated cells adjacent to epithelioid cells.  Prominent areas of necrosis are present.Immunohistochemical stains along with appropriate controls are performed and show the tumor cells to be positive for keratins cam 5.2 and AE1/AE3 and for mesothelioma markers Calretinin  CK5/6 and focally for D2-40.   Adenocarcinoma stains of TTF1  CD15 and BerEP-4 are negative.  CEA-m  negative.   Due to the previous history of prostate cancer  stains for PSA and PSAP are performed and are negative in the tumor cells.  This immunoprofile supports the above diagnosis.
A)  TAIL OF PANCREAS  FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION  CYTOLOGY:1.  Positive for adenocarcinoma (see comment).B)  MEDIASTINAL MASS  FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION  CYTOLOGY:1.  Positive for adenocarcinoma (see comment).Comment: Tumor cells from both sites  pancreas and mediastinum appear similar and probably represent the same neoplasm. Special stains are pending to further subtype this tumor including markers for lung  colon  mesothelial etc. These results will be added to this report as an addendum when available. .
LIVER  RIGHT LOBE; NEEDLE CORE BIOPSIES:1.  Metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma involving liver parenchyma.COMMENT:  Immunohistochemical stains along with appropriate controls are performed.  The tumor cells are positive for CK7  CK19  TTF-1 and pCEA while being negative for breast markers BRST-2  ER and mammoglobulin; negative for colonic markers CK20  cdx-2 and villin.  Hepatic marker of HCC is negative.  Thyroglobulin which is a thyroid marker is negative.   WT-1 and Vimentin are negative.  HER-2/neu stain is positive in both the liver parenchyma and tumor cells  which renders the stain non-contributory.The presence of TTF1 positive stain in the tumor cells will favor a lung primary.  Continued clinical and radiological correlation is recommended.Case discussed with Dr. Regan on 12/23/09.
LUNG  LEFT; NEEDLE CORE BIOPSIES:1.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma morphologically consistent with colonic origin.  COMMENT:  Immunohistochemical stains along with appropriate controls show the tumor cells positive for CK20  CDX2 and Villin while being negative for TTF1.  This immunprofile is in support to the above diagnosis.

The frozen section slide A1 have the largest fragment of the tumor and it measures on the slide 1.6 cm.  The remaining of tumor with adjacent uninvolved lung parenchyma measure microscopically 1 cm.   Radiologic correlation is recommended to accurately measure the tumor and if needed to update the stage.Three stapled lines of resection are present in the lobectomy specimen. The en-face sections are submitted in slides C3-C6.  Slide C4 shows focal involvement by the tumor  however  this could represent line of resection of the wedge and not a true margin  as discussed with Dr. Furnary at 2:40 pm on 12/11/09.This resection is compared with the previous resection of SV09-9496.  Although  all tumors are of adenocarcinomas  they are not identical which favor multiple synchronous tumors and should be staged separately.

20G CORE  RIGHT LUNG MASS:1.  Primary moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung. Comment:  This case was reviewed at the Daily Intradepartmental QA Conference.
RIGHT PARASPINAL MASS  BIOPSY:  Sections A1 and A2 contain five thin needle cores of striated muscle showing extensive invasion by a partly necrotic neoplasm having solid groups of viable atypical cells occasionally limited to perivascular areas. These cells have moderate to abundant amounts of non-pigmented pale amphophilic cytoplasm with ill-defined borders and irregularly rounded or ovoid  slightly hyperchromatic nuclei with prominent nucleoli and a few atypical mitoses.  The Ki-67 nuclear proliferation index is high (50-60%).  The tumor cells show strongly positive immunostaining for vimentin and focal weak immunostaining for tyrosinase antigens usually present in melanomas  but are negative for melan-A  S100 protein  HMB-45 and tyrosinase melanoma antigens.  The cells are positive for cytokeratin CAM 5.2 and focally positive for pan cytokeratins AE1/AE3  found in many carcinomas and in a small percentage of melanomas.  The cells are also positive for CD10 antigen frequently found in melanomas  renal cell carcinomas and  lymphomas  but are negative for renal cell carcinoma antigen and CD45 leukocyte common antigen.  The tumor cells are negative for Ber-Ep4 adenocarcinoma antigen  negative for CDX-2 antigen usually present in colorectal and other gastrointestial system carcinomas   negative for HEPPAR antigen often present in hepatocellular carcinoma  negative for TTF-1 antigen occurring in most non-small cell lung carcinomas  negative for cytokeratins 5/6 occurring in squamous carcinomas and mesotheliomas.and negative for cytokeratins 7 and 20 which are frequently coexpressed in urothelial carcinomas.   This cytokeratin 7/20 negative immunophenotype is characteristic melanoma  renal cell  prostatic and hepatocellular carcinomas.

LUNG  RIGHT UPPER LOBE; BIOPSIES:1.  Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma involving submitted endobronchial biopsies.COMMENT:  Immunohistochemical stains will be performed and reported later in an addendum.
UTERINE CERVIX  BIOPSY:1.  Adenocarcinoma (see comment).Comment: The adenocarcinoma is present within the stroma of the cervical biopsy and does not involve the overlying mucosa. The histological pattern is somewhat different than the usual appearing cervical adenocarcinoma. For these reasons a battery of immunohistochemical stains  was obtained with the following results: CK7+ CK20- CDX2- TTF-1- BRST-2- mammaglobin- WT- synaptophysin-CA125+ P16+ vimentin+ ER+ CEA+ and mucicarmine+. This profile is consistent with a primary cervical adenocarcinoma and tends to exclude metastatic lung  breast and GI primaries as well as endometrial carcinoma. Nevertheless  a metastatic lesion cannot be completely excluded.

LUL:  Samples from the left upper lung biopsy show primarily necrotic debris with a peripheral infiltrate of neoplastic cells having markedly elevated N:C ratio and powdery diffuse chromatin. Immunoperoxidase stains are positive for CD 56 and non-reactive for synaptophysin  chromogranin  CK 7/20 and CD 45. This pattern suggests a neuroendocrine component. The majority of the biopsy is necrotic debris. Comparing the features with those from the needle biopsy of the subcarinal lymph node NP-09-1906 which shows an adenocarcinoma  raises the possibility of a dimorphic tumor versus two distinct malignancies. Please correlate clinically.

LUNG  RIGHT  BIOPSIES:1.  Adenocarcinoma with enteric differentiation  favor metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma  see comment.COMMENT:  The biopsy material demonstrates the presence of a proliferation of atypical glandular structures inserted in a necrotic background and immunohistochemically characterized by the expression of cdx-2  CK20 and villin  while negative for TTF-1  PSA  P63  CK5/6 and CK7.  These findings are diagnostic of involvement by an adenocarcinoma showing morphological and immunophenotypical evidence of enteric differentiation.  ln view of the current clinical findings  they are felt to be most consistent with a metastatic adenocarcinoma  morphologically as well as immunophenotypically compatible with a colorectal primary.  Note is made however in this context of the patient's currently pending review of the patient's bladder biopsy material  which may contribute to this interpretation.Case discussed with Dr. C. Nichols and seen in consultation with Dr. J. Harter  who concurs with this interpretation.

BONE  RIGHT ISCHIUM  BIOPSY:1.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma  consistent with ovarian primary origin (see comment).COMMENT: The immunohistochemical profile of positive CK7 and negative CK20 can be seen in adenocarcinomas of lung  breast  upper gastrointestinal and gynecologic primary origins. The positive estrogen receptor staining and absence of staining for TTF-1 rules out a lung primary. The positive estrogen receptor staining also rules out an upper gastrointestinal primary. The lack of staining for BRST-2 and mammaglobin does not give support for a breast primary and some sources have implicated that positive CD117 staining  as seen here  would argue against a breast primary. The patient's recent abdominal CT report of 9/18/2009 is reviewed on Physician Portal and this describes a large right ovarian mass which is continguous with the uterus  as well as peritoneal studding consistent with metastatic disease. In the differential of ovarian versus endometrial primary tumors  some sources have implicated that positive E-cadherin staining  as seen here  would support an ovarian over endometrial primary source. Also  positive staining for CD117  as seen here  can often be seen in non-mucinous ovarian tumors. WT-1 is negative  as expected as the histologic features in the tumor as sampled here would favor endometrioid morphology rather than serous.In summary  the histologic features and immunohistochemical profile are those of a metastatic adenocarcinoma  consistent with ovarian primary origin  having features which favor endometrioid morphology based on the portion of the neoplasm represented in this sampling.
MASS  RIGHT HIP  NEEDLE CORE BIOPSY:1.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma with intestinal-like histologic features (see microscopic description and comment).COMMENT: The metastatic adenocarcinoma in this case has intestinal-like features with cytoplasmic goblet cell appearance in some areas. Strongly positive CK7 staining with weaker CK20 staining can be seen in adenocarcinomas of the upper gastrointestinal tract and this pattern would argue against a colonic primary source; however  appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinomas can show a higher proportion of CK7 positivity and less prominent CK20 staining and these tumors tend to show a brush border pattern on villin stain  as was seen here. Strongly positive CDX2 staining is also typical with gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas. Upper GI sources to rule out would include esophagus and stomach; pancreatic adenocarcinomas usually show cytoplasmic staining with villin  rather than the brush border pattern seen here  and the pancreas is described as normal on the patient's recent abdominal CT report of 9/20/2009. This histologic pattern and CK7/CK20 profile can also be seen in mucinous carcinomas of ovarian origin. Positive CDX2 staining can also be seen with mucinous ovarian carcinomas. However  ovarian mucinous carcinomas tend to show cytoplasmic staining without brush border reactivity with villin. Also  no ovarian masses are described in the recent pelvic CT report of 9/20/2009. This CK7/CK20 pattern can also be seen in carcinomas of breast ductal origin; however  this intestinal-like morphology would be unusual for a breast carcinoma and the absence of staining for estrogen receptor  BRST-2 and mammaglobin do not lend support for a breast primary. Given the presence of a large mass in the right lung with invasion into the hilum and mediastinum described on the chest CT of 9/20/2009  an enteric (intestinal-like) adenocarcinoma of primary lung origin would be in the differential  as these can show a CK7 positive/ CK20 positive profile with positive CDX2 staining and can closely imitate gastrointestinal primary adenocarcinomas in metastatic sites.In summary  in this metastatic adenocarcinoma with intestinal-like histologic features  primary origin from upper gastrointestinal sources such as esophagus and stomach would need to be ruled out on a clinincal basis. A pancreatic primary source appears unlikely based on the negative radiologic imaging impression. An appendical primary source would need to be excluded on a clinical basis but primary sources from elsewhere in the colon have been ruled out based on these findings. A mucinous ovarian primary source appears unlikely based on the findings here as well as on the negative radiologic imaging impression. An enteric (intestinal-like) adenocarcinoma of primary lung origin is in the differential based on the pathologic findings and the presence of a large lung mass; however  the other gastrointestinal primary sources listed above must first be excluded clinically.
LUNG  NEEDLE CORE BIOPSY:1.  Well differentiated adenocarcinoma  with mixed invasive and lepidic pattern  consistent with pulmonary origin (see comment).COMMENT: The growth pattern as well as the positive staining for TTF-1 in the neoplastic cells is consistent with pulmonary origin.

Per communication with the surgeon  there was considerable manipulation of the lobe during surgery  which could have contributed to these findings.  These slides were sent out to Dr. Colby at Mayo Clinic  who commented:                                                                                                     I agree with your observations.  You have very astutely some regions that are virtually indistinguishable from capillarities and if there were clinical or radiologic support for hemorrhage syndrome   I think it would seriously need to be considered....  I would favor that the inflammatory changes present in this biopsy are more likely related to the trauma of surgery over an underlying alveolar hemorrhage syndrome but obviously some clinical and radiological correlation would help in that regard...

LUNG  RIGHT; BIOPSIES:1.  Poorly differentiated carcinoma with extensive necrosis  consistent with metastasis from endometrial origin.COMMENT:  I am in full agreement with the submitted diagnosis. The submitted sections show four needle core biopsies of fibrotic tissue heavily involved by sheets of neoplastic cells with high N:C ratios and nuclei that vary moderately in size and shape with clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm and abundant necrosis.  A fragment of skeletal muscle and fibroadipose tissue is present and free of tumor.Immunohistochemical stains along with appropriate controls are performed at our institution and show the tumor cells to be strongly positive for CK7 and ER while being negative for TTF-1  CK20  P63  CK5/6  PR and mCEA.  This immunoprofile is in support of metastasis from uterine primary.Immunohistochemical stains also have been performed on the previous uterine carcinoma (SP09-18341) and show a similar immunoprofile of tumor cells strongly positive for CK7 and ER  while being negative for TTF-1 and PR  with focal positivity for monoclonal CEA.  Of note  lung adenocarcinoma are usually strongly positive for mCEA while endometrioid adenocarcinomas are either negative or focally positive.COMMENT:  A concurring second opinion has been rendered by Dr. Maritza Martel  OB/GYN Pathologist   who reviewed this case at St. Vincent's daily conference.

RIGHT CHEST WALL MASS:  The sections contain four needle core biopsy segments of fibrous tissue with scattered groups of large  atypical; rounded or polygonal epithelial cells arranged in solid nests and strands.  These cells have generally abundant non-keratinized amphophilic cytoplasm and large  irregularly rounded  slightly hyperchromatic nuclei with finely dispersed chromatin and small nucleoli.  Mitoses are rare.  The tumor cells show positive immunostaining for cytokeratins AE1/AE3  5/6  and 7 and nuclear immunostaining for p63 antigen  consistent with squamous cell carcinoma.  They are negative for cytokeratin 20 usually present in colorectal  bladder and some pancreatic carcinomas.  The tumor cells have a high nuclear proliferation rate ranging above 40% in some areas.  The cells show negative immunostaining for Ber-Ep-4 adenocarcinoma antigen and are negative for TTF-1 antigen occurring in most adenocarcinomas of the lung.  The cells are also negative for synaptophysin neuroendocrine tumor antigen.

LUNG  LEFT APICAL MASS  BIOPSY:1.  Adenocarcinoma  moderately differentiated  see comment.COMMENT:  The biopsy material demonstrates the presence of sparse  atypical glandular structures  inserted into a hyalinized fibrotic background.  The glandular lining epithelium is characterized by pleomorphic nuclei  relatively prominent nucleoli and abundant cytoplasm.  Mitotic figures are not easily identified.  The performed immunohistochemical stains demonstrate that the neoplastic elements are positive for CK7  TTF-1  show focal minimal patchy positivity for P63 and are characterized by an increased proliferative index  as assessed by a stain for Ki-67.  Stains for cytokeratin 20  CMV  herpes and P53 are negative.  Minimal patchy positivity for BerEP-4 is present.  In summary  these morphologic and immunophenotypic findings are most consistent with involvement by an adenocarcinoma associated with scar-like stromal changes.  Correlation with the clinical findings is recommended.Case seen in consultation with Dr. F. Curl  Dr. S. Hussein and Dr. Y. Wu  who concur with this interpretation.

Both described tumors are identical adenocarcinoma of mixed subtypes: acinar (90%) and solid (10%) patterns.  Both tumors show association with central scar  moderate lymphoid hyperplasia and scattered psammomatous type microcalcifications.  Both tumors appear to involve the adjacent emphysematous lung tissue.  Note:  Per submitted report of the gross description  there are two tumor foci.  One of the foci is present at least 2.4 cm away from the other tumor focus.  Also  the gross description of part 3 mentions that cassette (3F) represents a random section of pulmonary parenchyma away from the mass; however  this section is  of a tumor focus also.  It is not clear whether this is the same area of fibrosis representing thickened alveolar wall  as described grossly in part 1  or a random section that was not identified grossly as a tumor.

RIGHT FEMORAL HEAD:  Section A1 contains fragments of bone and cartilage from the femoral head.  The articular cartilage shows areas of irregular erosion and thinning.  Some of the medullary bone trabeculae are thin and widely spaced. The intramedullary tissues are fibrotic with no apparent hematopoietic activity.  There is a sclerotic 5.0 mm intramedullary focus of metastatic carcinoma bordered by fresh hemorrhage and a separate  2.0 mm intramedullary focus of similar tumor in another bone fragment.  Section A2 contains pieces of bone with relatively large amounts of sclerotic intramedullary tissue showing extensive involvement by metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma.  The tumor contains numerous small nests and thin strands of intermediate size atypical cells having moderate amounts of nonvacuolated  pale eosinophilic cytoplasm and irregularly rounded  ovoid or occasionally angulated nuclei with evenly dispersed chromatin  and predominantly indistinct nucleoli.  Mitoses are rare.  The tumor cells show positive immunostaining for cytokeratins AE!/AE3 and focal weak immunostaining for cytokeratin 20  but are negative for cytokeratin 7 usually present in breast carcinomas.  There is positive immunostaining  however for E-cadherin antigen characteristic of ductal carcinoma of the breast.  The tumor cells are negative for ER/PR and BRST-2 breast tumor antigens.

The second tumor focus ( 7 mm) is adenocarcinoma of mixed subtypes: bronchiolo-alveolar (90%) and acinar pattern (10%) and is present 5 cm away from the first focus in proximity of emphysematous changes.  The smallest tumor (6mm) is of papillary pattern and is present approximately 1.5 cm away from the second focus.   All three foci are morphologically different and thus considered separate synchronous primaries.A 3 mm focus of adenocarcinoma with bronchiolo-alveolar features is present at the inked surgical margin.  This focus represents also a new synchronous tumor rather than an extension of the largest focus to the margin.

PERITONEAL MASS:  The core biopsies show cribriform glands and small fused glands some containing intraluminal pink amorphous material.  The columnar cells have oval and large nuclei  small nucleoli  mild nuclear pleomorphism and some loss of nuclear polarity.  There is a fibroblastic response  patchy lymphocytic reaction and rare neutrophilic debris.  Another core biopsy shows unremarkable liver parenchyma  exhibiting normal sinusoids and bile ducts.  Neither bile stasis nor granuloma is identified.  In slide A2  there are some additional core biopsies showing abundant fibroblastic response and some scattered small mature lymphocytes.  The fibrous component shows some areas of edema or myxomatous degeneration versus mucinous pools.  Slide A3 includes a few particles of benign skeletal muscle.RESULTS OF IMMUNOPEROXIDASE STAINS:  A battery of immunoperoxidase stains was performed on block A1.  The results show that the neoplastic cells are positive with cytokeratin 7  poly-CEA and villin  and are negative with cytokeratin 20 and CDX-2.A second battery of immunoperoxidase stain results show that the neoplasm is strongly positive with the mib-1 showing an elevated nuclear positivity of nearly 100%.  The tumor is negative with calretinin  CA-125  estrogen receptor  progesterone receptor  and TTF-1 immunoperoxidase stains.  The neoplasm has an unknown primary  however  the positive CEA helps to support the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma  and the negative calretinin and WT-1 suggest that this is not mesothelioma.  The negative ER/PR do not necessarily exclude a breast primary and the negative TTF-1 (pulmonary marker) does not necessarily exclude a lung primary.  The ovarian marker  CA-125  is negative.  Clinical correlation is necessary to determine the primary neoplasm.

PERICARDIAL FLUID:1.  Positive for cytologically malignant cells  consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (see comment).COMMENT:  The results of the immunoperoxidase stains support the diagnosis of carcinoma based on the positive cytokeratins 7 and 20 immunoperoxidase stains.  Cytokeratins 7 and 20 are commonly positive together in transitional cell carcinoma  pancreatic carcinoma and ovarian mucinous carcinoma.Following  the processing of this cell block  the patient expired and underwent an autopsy  revealing tumor in the lung  liver  adrenal gland  kidney and intercostal space.  At this time there is no obvious neoplasm in the ovaries  pancreas or the urinary bladder.  Despite a negative TTF-1 immunoperoxidase stain result  the neoplasm may represent a lung primary; however  additional immunoperoxidase stains will be performed on autopsy material for further evaluation.

The previous biopsy exhibits morphologic features of small cell carcinoma that strongly expresses the neuroendocrine marker synaptophysin and is additionally TTF-1 positive  which is different than the current chest wall mass.This case was reviewed at the Daily Intradepartmental QA Conference.  The findings were discussed with Dr. Ali Khaki on 06/18/09.A small panel of additional immunostains will be performed and the results reported in an addendum.

A)  LIVER  NEEDLE CORE BIOPSY:1.  Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma  see comment.B)  LUNG  LATERALITY UNSPECIFIED; BIOPSIES:1.  Scar tissue with few metaplastic cells  see comment.2.  No definite malignancy is identified.COMMENT: This case was sent out to Dr. Thomas V. Colby who agrees with the above diagnosis.  In his letter he commented:                                                                                                     I agree with your observations.  The liver biopsy clearly shows an adenocarcinoma and without any history  I would put cholangiocarcinoma on the top of the differential.  Given the fact that this case has multiple nodules  metastases  such as metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma might also need to be considered...I am unable to make a definitive diagnosis of malignancy on the basis of lung biopsy.  There is a background sclerosis typical of that seen in lung adenocarcinoma but I did not think there was sufficient cytologic atypia for a definitive diagnosis.  If a definitive diagnosis of the lung nodule is needed additional biopsies could be considered                                                                                                   .Case discussed with Dr. Cowell at 2:00p on 6/9/09.
FOUR 18-GAUGE LIVER MASS CORE SAMPLES:  Sections of the liver core biopsy demonstrate extensive replacement of the liver parenchyma by a poorly differentiated carcinoma with extensive necrosis.  The tumor is aggregated into nests with central necrosis and are composed of hyperchromatic cells with minimal eosinophilic cytoplasm.  In some areas  the cytoplasm is clear.  Immunohistochemical studies show the tumor to be extensively positive for CK5/6  and only focally positive for p63  CK7  and CK20.  It is also focally positive for CDX-2 and positive for p16.  It is negative for vimentin  WT-1  HepPar-1  TTF-1  chromogranin  synaptophysin  BRST-2  and ER.  This immunoprofile tends to exclude hepatocellular carcinoma  neuroendocrine carcinoma  and metastatic breast and lung adenocarcinoma  as well as serous carcinoma of the ovary.  However  there are some ovarian and colorectal tumors that may exhibit squamous differentiation  thus both remain in the differential diagnosis.  CONSULT:  MM
A)  CECAL POLYP:  The colonic mucosa shows tufting and hyperplastic change of the surface epithelium.  The crypt profiles appear serrated on cross section.  There is no evidence of dysplasia or invasive malignancy.B)  OMENTAL CORES:  Sections of the core biopsies demonstrate replacement of the omental fat by a moderately to poorly differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma surrounded by a desmoplastic response.  There is abortive gland formation as well as single cell infiltration.  There is mucin production and the cells show pleomorphic hyperchromatic  enlarged nuclei.  The glands are angulated and cribriformed in architecture occasionally.  Areas of necrosis are also present.  Immunohistochemical studies show the tumor to be diffusely positive for cytokeratin 7 and cytokeratin 19.  It is only focally positive for cytokeratin 20.  It is negative for CDX2  TTF-1  and PSA.  This immunoprofile supports a pancreaticobiliary tract or upper gastrointestinal tract primary  and tends to exclude metastatic lung  colorectal and prostatic carcinoma.

RIGHT SUPRACLAVICULAR:  Section A1 contains five needle core biopsy segments of tissue  two of which are predominantly striated muscle and three are lymphoid tissue  two of which are almost completely replaced by sclerosing poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma.  The tumor cells show malignant nuclear and cytoplasmic pleomorphism with moderate to abundant amounts of non-vacuolated  non-keratinized amphophilic cytoplasm having well-defined borders and relatively large  irregularly rounded or angulated  hyperchromatic nuclei frequently containing one or more prominent nucleoli and occasional cytoplasmic intranuclear pseudo inclusions.  There are moderate numbers of atypical mitoses.  The tumor cells are discohesive or form loosely cohesive groups of cells showing no tubuloglandular differentiation.  Section A2 contains an additional small piece of striated muscle and a small piece of lymphoid tissue showing extensive replacement by tumor. The tumor cells show positive immunostaining for cytokeratins AE1/AE3  cam 5.2 and CK7.  They also show focal weak immunostaining for cytokeratins 5/6 occurring in squamous and urothelial carcinomas and CK20 occurring in colorectal carcinoma or in some lung  pancreatic and urothelial carcinomas.  The tumor cells are negative for TTF-1 antigen occurring in about two-thirds of poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinomas of the lung.  They also show negative immunostaining for BerEP-4 adenocarcinoma antigen  negative immunostaining for melan-A melanoma antigen  negative immunostaining for CD56 and synaptophysin neuroendocrine tumor antigens and negative immunostaining for CD45 and CD30 antigens occurring in anaplastic large cell lymphomas.  The tumor cells have a high Ki-67 nuclear proliferation index ranging up to about 40%.
RETROPERITONEAL MASS  NEEDLE CORE BIOPSY:1.  Poorly differentiated carcinoma (see microscopic description and comment).  COMMENT:  The case is discussed with the clinician  Dr. Ivan Law.  Dr. Law states that the patient has diffuse adenopathy involving the hilar  mediastinal and retroperitoneal regions.  The current specimen is from a retroperitoneal lymph node.  Dr. Law states that the patient apparently had a prior diagnosis in December  2008 at Good Samaritan Hospital which was interpreted to represent poorly differentiated carcinoma. The patient's clinical findings are reviewed on Physician Portal. A PET scan report of May 20  2009 describes increased uptake in the lymph node regions described above as well as in supraclavicular lymph nodes and multiple lesions in the spleen.The immunohistochemical profile is not specific. The lesion is a poorly differentiated carcinoma based on positive staining for AE1/AE3 and cytokeratin 7 and absence of staining for melanoma associated markers (S100 and Melan-A) and lymphoid associated marker (CD45). BerEP4  a marker associated with many adenocarcinomas  is negative here and evidence of specific differentiation is not seen on H&E stains. The carcinoma is cytokeratin 7 positive and cytokeratin 20 negative; this profile can be seen with carcinomas of lung  breast  upper GI and gynecologic primary origins. No evidence of a primary lesion is described in any of these sites on the PET scan. The lack of staining for estrogen receptor  BRST-2 and mammaglobin would argue against a breast primary. The negative estrogen receptor would also argue against a gynecologic primary and the negative WT-1 would argue specifically against a serous gynecologic tumor. CD56 and synaptophysin are negative  which would argue against a neuroendocrine carcinoma. TTF-1 is negative  which would argue against a lung adenocarcinoma primary. Cytokeratin 5/6 is negative and p63 is focally positive; squamous carcinomas  of lung or upper GI origin  while expressing p63  are typically positive for cytokeratin 5/6 as well. Villin is negative  which does not by itself exclude the possibility of an upper GI primary  including pancreaticobiliary origin  and a minority of these carcinomas can show some expression for p63.In this setting with positive hilar  mediastinal  supraclavicular and retroperitoneal lymph nodes as well as spleen  origin from lung and upper GI primary sources  including panceaticobiliary origin  should be considered; however  the immunohistochemical profile is not definitive and lesions are not described clinically in these regions. Therefore  correlation with clinical and radiologic information would be required to determine if a primary lung or upper GI source  including pancreaticobiliary origin  is present or whether another primary source can be identified.
LIVER  NEEDLE CORE BIOPSY:1.  Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (see microscopic description and comment).  COMMENT:  Review of the patient's clinical information on Physician Portal reveals an abdominal ultrasound report of May 19  2009 which describes multiple lesions within the liver as well as a lesion in the uncinate process of the pancreas and a lesion in the right kidney.  The findings of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with positive cytokeratin-7 expression and absence of cytokeratin-20 expression can be seen with adenocarcinomas of lung  breast  gynecologic and upper GI primary sources  including pancreaticobiliary origin.  The cytokeratin-7 positive/ cytokeratin-20 negative profile would argue against a renal primary source and this same profile  as well as the negative Heppar stain  would argue against hepatocellular carcinoma.  The lack of staining for estrogen receptor and brst-2 would argue against a breast primary source.  The absence of staining for estrogen receptor would also argue against a gynecologic primary source.  The absence of TTF-1 would argue against a lung primary source.  The histologic findings and immunohistochemical profile would favor a primary cholangiocarcinoma  although metastasis from an upper gastrointestinal source  including pancreas  would need to be considered  since immunohistochemical markers do not reliably distinguish carcinomas of biliary tract origin from upper GI and pancreatic origin.  Clinical correlation would therefore be required in this regard.  CONSULTATION:  Xiaohong Cai  M.D.  Ph.D.  Gastrointestinal Pathologist
LUNG CORES  RIGHT UPPER LOBE:1.  Well-differentiated adenocarcinoma  see comment.Comment:  This case was sent out in consultation to Mayo Clinic where it was reviewed by Drs. Henry Tazelaar and K. O. Leslie.  In the letter  Dr. Tazelaar commented:                                                                                                     The degree of cellularity  pilling up  and the monotony of the cells lining the alveoli are all features point towards a diagnosis of malignancy.  We do not see definite invasion in the current biopsy  but the degree of pilling up in some places suggest that perhaps this may not turn out to be bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma if resection is undertaken                                                                                                   .Case discussed with Dr. Riddick notified at 1:30 pm on 6/01/09.

ANTERIOR CHEST WALL  LEFT  CORE BIOPSY:1.  Metastatic carcinoma.Comment:  This tumor is not morphologically similar to that seen in the patient's prior surgical specimen (SV04-3997)  which is reviewed and showed a metastatic adenocarcinoma to the lung consistent with prostate origin.  The patient also has a history of renal cancer and that sample is not available for review.  The immunohistochemical profile would argue against prostate but could support the GU origin  especially if the renal tumor was urothelial in nature.  Clinical and radiographic correlation is suggested.

BIOPSY  RIGHT UPPER LOBE:  Sections reveal fragments of bronchial mucosa and lung parenchyma with involvement of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
SACRAL MASS  NEEDLE CORE BIOPSY:1.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma (see comment). COMMENT:  The staining pattern of positivity for cytokeratin 7 and negative for cytokeratin 20 along with the faint estrogen receptor reaction at least suggests the possibility of breast primary.  Other markers  however  that are often expressed in tumors of breast origin (BRST-2  mammoglobin  and progesterone receptor) are negative  and other possibilities including lung  cannot be excluded.This case was reviewed at the Daily Intradepartmental QA Conference.
LUNG  RIGHT UPPER LOBE  BIOPSY:1.  Involvement by adenocarcinoma  see comment.  COMMENT:  The core biopsy demonstrates the presence of glandular proliferation  characterized by focal mucinous differentiation.  The performed immunohistochemical stains demonstrate that the neoplastic elements are positive with cytokeratin 7  negative for cytokeratin 20 and CK5/6  and show focal weak positivity with p63.  Stains for TTF-1  cdx-2 and ER are negative.  In summary  although these findings are diagnostic of involvement by adenocarcinoma  the immunophenotypical findings are nonspecific and fail to definitively distinguish between a lung primary or a secondary metastatic involvement.  Correlation with the clinical findings is therefore recommended.  Case seen in consultation with Dr. Sanaa Hussain  who concurs with this interpretation.

LIVER  18-GAUGE CORE BIOPSY:1.  Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma involving liver  see comment.COMMENT:  Immunohistochemical studies are performed on the tumor  and the tumor expresses cytokeratin 7.  It is negative for cytokeratin 20  TTF-1  BRST-2  estrogen receptor  and CDX-2.  The immunoprofile is nonspecific  and lung  breast or pancreaticobiliary/upper gastrointestinal tract metastasis are all possibilities.  The immunoprofile does tend to exclude a colorectal metastasis.  Clinical and radiographic correlation recommended.

Vascular invasion is present.COMMENT:  Immunohistochemical stains along with appropriate controls are performed and show the tumor cells to be diffusely positive for AE1/AE3  Cam 5.2   ER and focally for BRST-2 and mammoglobin  while being negative for TTF-1 and CK7  and CK20.  This immunoprofile is in support of metastatic breast cancer to the lung. The previous breast slides are not available for our review and comparison.Per surgeon notes the hormonal studies were performed in an outside institution and will be repeated if requested.
SITE OF T3 LESION:1.  Focal metastatic adenocarcinoma  favor lung primary (see comment) COMMENT:  Sections shows scattered small clusters of neoplastic glands within the hypocellular bone marrow with focal dense fibrosis. The neoplastic cells are large in size with oval to irregular nuclear contours  fine chromatin  inconspicuous nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. No mucin production is found.The subsequent immunostains show the neoplastic glands to be positive for pankeratin  keratin 7 and CEA-m  but negative for TTF-1  keratin 20  BRST-2  mammoglobin  ER and renal cell carcinoma markers.  The negativity of keratin 20 essentially rules out the possibility of metastatic colorectal carcinoma.  The negativity of BRST-2  mammoglobin and ER argues against the possibility of metastatic breast carcinoma.  The negativity of RCC does not support metastatic renal cell carcinoma.  Given the clinical presentation of lung mass  the overall morphologic and immunophenotypical findings are most suggestive of metastatic adenocarcinoma of pulmonary primary  despite the fact that the immunostain for TTF-1 is negative in this case.  Clinical and radiographic correlation is recommended for complete interpretation.

RIGHT APICAL MASS  CORE NEEDLE BIOPSY:1.  Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of lung primary  involving all biopsy cores and occupying approximately 60% of biopsy tissue volume  with associated extensive fibrosis.  COMMENT:  Intradepartmental consultation was performed by Sanaa Hussain  M.D.  who concurs with the diagnosis.
MEDIASTINAL MASS  CORE NEEDLE BIOPSY:1.  Poorly differentiated metastatic adenocarcinoma with focal mucinous differentiation (see comment  microscopic description and immunohistochemistry). COMMENT:  The morphologic findings are those of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with focal mucinous differentiation.  The subsequent immunostains show the neoplastic cells to be positive for keratin 7  but negative for TTF-1  keratin 20  cdx-2 and BRST-2.  The immunostain pattern rules out the possibility of metastatic adenocarcinoma from colorectal and breast origin  but fails to rule out the possibility of adenocarcinoma of lung primary due to the fact that about 25% of pulmonary adenocarcinoma is negative for TTF-1.  In addition  the possibility of metastatic adenocarcinoma from upper GI and a primary mediastinal adenocarcinoma are still in the differentiation.  Therefore  clinical and radiographic correlation is necessary for complete interpretation.Intradepartmental consultation was performed by Dr. Sanaa Hussain  Pulmonary Pathologist   who concurs with the diagnosis.The diagnosis was discussed with Dr. Daniel Loube at approximately 3:00 pm on April 20  2009.
A)  INFERIOR PULMONARY LIGAMENT BIOPSY:  Sections demonstrate fragments of fibroadipose tissue which are entirely involved by a malignant process composed of cells with high N:C ratios and nuclei that vary prominently in size and shape and show some smudged appearance and lightly eosinophilic cytoplasm.  The tumor cells invade in a single-cell pattern with associated marked desmoplasia.B)  LYMPH NODE  9R AND C)  8R LYMPH NODE:  Microscopic examination corresponds to the above diagnoses.D)  ANTERIOR LATERAL PLEURA:  Sections demonstrate fragments of fibroadipose tissue and skeletal muscle.  The fibroadipose tissue is markedly involved by a malignant process composed of cells with high N:C ratio forming single cells and glands.  One fragment shows mesothelial cell hyperplasia and mild infiltration by chronic inflammatory cells composed mostly of lymphocytes.Immunohistochemical stains along with appropriate controls are performed on part D1 and show the tumor cells to be positive for TTF-1  CK7  CEA-m and CD15 (adenocarcinoma stains)  while being negative for CK20 (colon origin) and mesothelial cell markers of Calretinin and WT-1 which highlighted the surface mesothelium. This immunoprofile is in support of lung primary.  (mgh)
CHEST AND LUNG MASS BIOPSY:  The submitted sections contain one core of soft tissue and two cores of pulmonary tissue.  All three are infiltrated by nests and cords of poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma with squamoid differentiation  but without glandular differentiation.  The neoplastic cells are large in size  with oval to irregular nuclear contours  fine chromatin  prominent nucleoli and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No keratinization is found.  The subsequent immunostains show the neoplastic cells to be positive for keratin AE1/AE3 and keratin 7  but negative for keratin 20  TTF-1  CEA-m  cdx-2  calretinin and PSA.  The negativity of keratin 20 and cdx-2 essentially rules out the possibility of metastatic carcinoma from colorectal origin.  The negativity of calretinin rules out the possibility of mesothelioma.  The negativity of PSA rules out the possibility of metastatic  poorly differentiated prostatic adenocarcinoma.  The overall morphologic findings are most consistent with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of lung primary.
A)  PROSTATE (TURP SPECIMEN):  Frozen section control FSCA1 contains three small pieces of prostatic tissue having relatively increased fibromuscular stroma with a few scattered groups of glands predominantly showing cystic atrophy.  No prostatic glandular neoplasia is identified.B)  PROSTATE (TURP):  Sections B1 through B33 contain multiple chips of prostatic and bladder neck tissue.  The prostatic tissues have generally increased fibromuscular stroma and groups of hyperplastic glands with numerous interspersed atrophic glands frequently showing cystic dilatation.  There are small scattered areas of chronic inflammation.  No high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or  prostatic carcinoma is identified in the prostatic tissues  but sections B7  B8 and B29 contain pieces of bladder muscularis and submucosa showing variably extensive infiltration by discohesive  atypical   intermediate to large-size  irregularly rounded or polygonal cells with moderate to abundant amounts of amphophilic cytoplasm having well-defined cytoplasmic borders.  A small proportion of these cells contain one or more cytoplasmic vacuoles which do not displace or mold the cell nuclei.  The nuclei are irregularly rounded or ovoid with evenly dispersed chromatin and indistinct or small nucleoli.  Mitoses are rare but the cells show a high Ki-67 nuclear proliferation index of 30-40%.The tumor cells show positive immunostaining for cytokeratin Cam 5.2  cytokeratins AE1/AE3 and cytokeratin 7 found in many epithelial tumors.  The cells are negative for cytokeratins 5/6 and p63 antigen usually occurring bladder urothelial carcinoma and squamous carcinoma.  The cells are negative for Ber Ep-4 adenocarcinoma antigen and are negative for PSA  PSAP and racemase (p504s) antigens frequently present in prostatic adenocarcinoma.  The cells are negative for cdx-2 antigen occurring in nearly all colorectal carcinomas and for TTF-1 antigen occurring in most non-small cell carcinomas of the lung.  The cells show negative immunostaining for melan-A  S-100 protein and HMB-45 melanoma antigens.  They are negative for synaptophysin frequently present in neuroendocrine cell tumors and negative for CD45  CD20 and CD3 antigens occurring in lymphomas.  The cells are negative for CD30 and AFP antigens occurring in embryonal and yolk sac tumors of the testis  but  show focal weak immunostaining for PLAP antigen occurring in seminomas  which are negative for cytokeratins AE!/AE3 and CK7.  The immunophenotype of the tumor cells is consistent with an epithelial neoplasm  but is otherwise nonspecific.
RUL LUNG BIOPSY:  The sections contain five fragments of chronically inflamed and fibrotic tissue showing variably extensive infiltration by large  atypical epithelial cells in solid  nested and trabecular arrangements.  No tubuloglandular structures are noted.  These cells are rounded or polygonal with generally abundant  non-vacuolated amphophilic cytoplasm and rounded or ovoid nucleoli with evenly dispersed chromatin and small nucleoli.  These atypical cells show positive immunostaining for cytokeratins AE1/AE3 and cytokeratin 7.  They are also focally positive for 5/6  and p63 antigens usually present in squamous carcinomas and are negative for BerEP-4 adenocarcinoma antigen.  The cells show very focal immunostaining for TTF-1 antigen occurring in the majority of non-small cell lung carcinomas.  The cells are negative for synaptophysin neuroendocrine tumor antigen.  Ziehl-Nielsen and Fite stained sections  for AFB and GMS stains for fungi are negative for microorganisms.   (nm)

One needle core biopsy segment of normal striated muscle.B)  RIGHT CARDIOPHRENIC NODULE (NEEDLE CORE BIOPSY):1.  Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in one needle core biopsy.COMMENT:  The immunohistochemical phenotype of the tumor cells is inconclusive for diagnosis of primary vs metastatic adenocarcinoma..CONSULTATION:  Sidney H. Rosenheim  M.D.
A)  LUNG MASS:  Section A1 contains needle core biopsy fragments of chronically inflamed and fibrotic lung tissue infiltrated by an extensively necrotic neoplasm with solid groups of atypical polygonal epithelial cells having irregularly rounded or ovoid  variably hyperchromatic nuclei with small to moderately conspicuous nucleoli and chromocenters. A few mitoses are noted.  The cells show no evident cytoplasmic keratinization or tubuloglandular arrangements.  Section A2 contains small fragments of tumor intermixed with relatively large amounts of blood clot.  The tumor cells form predominantly solid trabecular arrangements and have a somewhat squamous appearance  but show no cytoplasmic keratinization.  Moderate numbers of mitoses are noted.  The atypical cells show positive immunostaining for cytokeratins AE1/AE3  but are negative for cytokeratins 7 and 20 and TTF-1 antigens   which favors poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma over adenocarcinoma.  The atypical cells are aso negative for synaptophysin neuroendocrine tumor antigen. (FDC)B)  RETROPERITONEAL MASS:  Sections demonstrate three cores of lymphoid tissue; two of them are diffusely infiltrated by sheets of intermediate to large atypical lymphoid cells intermixed with scattered small mature T cells with a focal vaguely nodular pattern  and one core shows a predominantly nodular pattern with fibrosis.  The majority of neoplastic cells have a monocytoid appearance with clear cytoplasm  but the nuclei are more irregularly in shape and larger in size than those of  conventional monocytoid B cells normally seen in marginal zone lymphoma.  In addition  many neoplastic cells show fine chromatin and prominent nucleoli with active mitoses and focal increased endothelial vascularity.  The appearance is that of diffuse high grade B cell lymphoma.  The subsequent immunostains show the lymphoma cells to be strongly positive for CD20 with follicular lymphoma phenotypic features (positive for CD10  bcl-6 and bcl-2)  and  with a markedly increased Ki-67 proliferative rate (approximately 80%).  No CD20/CD43 coexpression is found. The stains for CD5 and cyclin-D1 are negative in lymphoma cells  ruling out the possibility of blastoid mantle cell lymphoma.  The stains for CD21 and CD23 highlight the distorted or expanded follicular dendritic meshwork.  The stain for CD3 highlights scattered small reactive T cells and focal interfollicular T cell aggregates.The overall morphologic and immunophenotypical findings support a diagnosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma  possibly arising from follicular lymphoma.

Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (see comment and pathologic staging summary).COMMENT  The submitted sections demonstrate the presence of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma characterized by nests and clusters of atypical epithelial elements with hyperchromatic nuclei  prominent nucleoli and abundant cytoplasm  alternating moderately differentiated areas demonstrating preserved glandular architecture to foci with the presence of sheets of poorly differentiated neoplastic elements.  Assessment of size is difficult due to  the fragmentation of the tissue  with the size of 2.8 cm being an estimate based on the number of positive submitted tissue blocks having significant tumor involvement (7 positive blocks x 0.4 cm of block thickness = 2.8 cm).  The assessment of the margin  is made difficult by the presence of numerous detached tumor fragments. No definitive evidence of involvement of the vascular and bronchial margin of resection is however apparent.  Note is made of the presence of tumor clusters involving the visceral pleura (section D6)  a findings also demonstrated by a stain for elastin.  The performed immunohistochemical stains are compatible with the above interpretation  demonstrating the positivity of the neoplastic tumor cells for CK7  focal weak positivity for CK 5/6  focal expression of mucicarmine and absence of significant positivity for p63.  Minor focal weak positivity for TTF-1 is also identified.  A stain for CK20 appears to be negative in the neoplastic elements.CONSULTATION:  The case is seen in consultation with Sidney H.

BLADDER MASS:1.  Invasive  small cell  undifferentiated  neuroendocrine carcinoma/neoplasm (see comment).COMMENT:  At this time the results of immunoperoxidase stains support the diagnosis of small cell undifferentiated neuroendocrine neoplasm with a high proliferative rate; (mib-1 is nearly 100% in the neoplastic cells).  CD56 and synaptophysin are positive  indicative of a neuroendocrine neoplasm.As discussed with Dr. Menashe on Friday 03-13-09  at approximately 3:30 pm  this patient has a prior history of prostatic carcinoma (approximately fifteen years ago)  the subtype of which is unknown at this time.  Although this does not look like a typical prostatic adenocarcinoma  a prostatic neuroendocrine neoplasm has not been ruled out at this time.  From the current markers  the TTF-1 (pulmonary marker) is negative  suggesting that this is not metastatic from a lung primary.  Clinical correlation  as always  is required.Meanwhile  a second battery of immunoperoxidase stains is pending for further evaluation  and a final report will follow intramural consultation.

The two tumor foci are separated by a 5.5 cm area of normal lung parenchyma  are  histologically different.  Therefore they will be considered two synchronous tumors and will be staged accordingly.  The submitted specimen was received with two stapled lines of which one was previously marked by the surgeon as true parenchymal margin.  The submitted sections from this stapled line is negative for invasive carcinoma.  However  the second stapled line which was not marked as true parenchymal margin is positive for papillary adenocarcinoma and is grossly abut the second smaller tumor focus (2.5cm).These findings were discussed with Dr. Handy at 1:20 pm on 3/10/2009.

ESOPHAGEAL BIOPSY:1.  Poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma with ulceration  consistent with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of esophageal primary (see comment).COMMENT:  The patient's previous right upper lobectomy specimen (SP-06-21301) was reviewed concurrently and contributes to the above interpretation.  The poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma noted in the previously specimen is morphologically different from the current poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma in the esophagus.  Additional immunostains were performed on the previous pulmonary adenocarcinoma and show the tumor cells to be positive for keratin 7 and TTF-1  but negative for keratin 20 and p63.  In contrast  the immunostains show the current esophageal poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma to be positive for p63  but negative for keratin 7 and TTF-1.  The different immunostaining patterns between these two tumors further supports that they are two different primary tumors rather than a primary lung tumor with late esophageal metastasis.  In review of the patient's history in Physician Portal  the patient also presented with a mediastinal mass which involved the esophagus.  As this esophageal carcinoma is poorly differentiated  the possibility of a poorly differentiated metastatic thymic carcinoma or metastatic poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma from other sites  such as head and neck   cannot be entirely excluded by histologic examination alone.  Therefore  clinical and radiographic correlation is necessary for complete interpretation.Intradepartmental consultation was performed by Dr. Sidney Rosenheim  who concurs with the diagnosis.The diagnosis was discussed with Dr. Alan Savoy at approximately 3:30 pm on 02/18/2009.

LUNG MASS  RIGHT LOWER LOBE:1.  Moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.COMMENT:  This right lower lobe biopsy is compared to a previous liver biopsy  SP09-2055.  Morphologically  these tumors are different with that in the liver being poorly differentiated and composed of large pleomorphic cells with dense cytoplasm and variably prominent nucleoli.  The mass in the lung is composed of tall cells with more vesicular chromatin  less conspicuous nucleoli  and well defined papillary architecture.  Immunophenotypically  these tumors differ in that the tumor in the lung is strongly positive for cytokeratin 20 (repeated)  while that in the liver is negative.  Furthermore  the neoplasm in the lung is focally positive for BerEP4  while that in the liver is negative.  That having been said  the immunophenotype of the lung tumor is not totally typical of primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma in that typically lung cancers are negative for cytokeratin 20 and positive for TTF-1.  (Approximately 10% of lung cancers are positive for CK20).  The exact opposite pertains to this neoplasm.The chest CT suggests that this is a large (4 cm) mass in the right lower lobe with morphology suggestive of a primary lung neoplasm.  The abdominal CT demonstrated only the liver metastasis  but the pancreas and other abdominal organs were found to be negative.A PET CT might be useful in identifying other possible primary sites.  In conclusion  we are confronted with two neoplasms with different morphologies and immunophenotypes  and furthermore  the neoplasm in the lung is not textbook typical of that organ.  Further clinical correlation will be required.A concurring second opinion has been rendered by Yaping Wu  M.D.

A)  RIGHT UPPER LOBE:  Sections A1 through A3 represent enface sections from the staple line.  These sections are negative for neoplasm.  Foci of bronchial metaplasia are evident and fragments of bronchus including bronchial cartilage are included.  Large vessels are also noted and are negative for neoplastic involvement.  The shorter staple line on A4 is also negative for neoplasm.  A5 and A6 demonstrate the intermediate size staple line and these sections demonstrate bronchi and vasculature  as well as pulmonary parenchyma.  No neoplasm is evident on these sections.  Visceral pleura is included.  The large mass is included on slides A7 through A9.  This is a poorly differentiated carcinoma with clear cell features.  The tumor grows as irregular nests in a sclerotic stroma.  The malignant epithelial cells are characterized by irregular ovoid nuclei with coarse nuclear chromatin and small nucleoli.  Abundant clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm is present.  The neoplasm is present in a dense fibroblastic stroma.  Tumor is present immediately beneath the visceral pleura which is retracted by the neoplasm.  The tumor also surrounds regional blood vessels.Slide A10 demonstrates lung tissue with adherent parietal pleura.  Subpleural blebs are present with emphysematous change and chronic inflammation.  There is bronchiolar metaplasia of the cyst walls. Blocks A8 and A9 are stained with a panel of monoclonal antibodies to further subclassify the neoplasm.  The tumor is found to strongly express cytokeratin 7 while it is negative for keratin 5/6  which does stain some of the benign metaplastic epithelium.  p63 is variably positive.  BerEP-4  which is an adenocarcinoma marker  is negative but polyclonal CEA is strongly positive.  Mucicarmine stains are negative.  The neuroendocrine markers CD56 and synaptophysin are negative.  Lymphatic vascular invasion can be demonstrated with immunostains for D2-40.  Vascular invasion is also identified with an elastic stain.B)  9R LYMPH NODE:  A single lymph node is present and is stained with hematoxylin and eosin and with an immunohistochemical reagent for cytokeratin AE1/AE3.  This shows anthracofibrosis.  The pleural tissue adjacent to the node is positive.  C)  8R LYMPH NODE:  A lymph node with well preserved follicular architecture is present.  This is negative for metastatic carcinoma and a section stained for keratin AE1/AE3 is also found to be negative.  D)  7R LYMPH NODE:  Four lymph nodes with anthracosis are recovered.  All are found to be negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/4) and a section stained with AE1/AE3 is also found to be negative for metastatic disease.  E)  2R LYMPH NODE:  Two lymph nodes are recovered and are found to be negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/2).  These show partial fatty replacement and anthracofibrosis.

LEFT UPPER LOBE  TRANSBRONCHIAL BIOPSY:1.  Adenocarcinoma  favor lung primary  additional special stain is pending.Comment: This case was reviewed a departmental QA conference.
A)  CERVICAL SPINAL TUMOR:  The specimen exhibits particles of viable and non-viable bone  including cartilaginous tissue.  Some of the marrow has reactive fibrosis.  Embedded in this  there are some very rare atypical clusters of large cells with mildly pleomorphic nuclei  distorted frayed cytoplasm and increased N:C ratios.  These cells have small nucleoli and show no evidence of glandular formation or intercellular bridges.  There is no intracytoplasmic pigment.  One of the clusters has a vague pseudogland contour.  The cytoplasm is pink and ill-defined.  In slide A2  there are additional minute cellular clusters composed of atypical large cells with hyperchromatic oval enlarged nuclei and ill-defined pink cytoplasm.  These are associated with reactive bone.  The irregular jagged bony trabeculae have viable osteocytes and occasional mosaic lines.  B)  CERVICAL SPINAL TUMOR:  Additional particles of viable bone and cartilaginous tissue show some areas of reactive bone  fibroblastic marrow and some rare epithelial cells  one forming a splayed gland  consistent with an adenocarcinoma.  The nuclei are hyperchromatic and mildly to moderately enlarged.  Cytoplasm is cuboidal and ill-defined pink.  At least one complex gland is apparent and splayed open in a larger fragment.  A battery of immunoperoxidase stains is performed on block B1.  The results show that the neoplastic glands are positive with TTF-1 (pulmonary marker)  polyclonal CEA  cytokeratin 7  and cytokeratin 20.  The tumor is negative with villin  BerEP4  and cdx-2 immunoperoxidase stains.  Given the positive TTF-1 result  a pulmonary primary is favored  despite the fact that most lung primaries are positive for cytokeratin 7 and negative for cytokeratin 20.  Other adenocarcinomas which may be positive for cytokeratin 7 and cytokeratin 20 would include pancreatic carcinoma  however  as mentioned  a positive TTF-1 would favor a pulmonary primary instead.
PLEURAL FLUID:  Samples from the pleural fluid are presented on two direct smears  a concentrated and two levels of cell block.  Clusters of malignant tumor cells are seen diffusely present on the material with cells having pleomorphic nuclei  prominent nucleoli and irregular nuclear margins.  Cytoplasmic vacuolization is seen.  Cell in cell arrangement is present.  The tumor cells are associated with a lymphocytic cell population  as well as scattered reactive-appearing mesothelial cells.  Immunohistochemical stains show strong immunoreactivity for cytokeratin 7.  Calretinin stains show positivity within the surrounding mesothelial cells  however  the tumor cells are negative.  The tumor cells are also immunonegative for TTF-1 and cytokeratin 20.  Although most lung adenocarcinomas do show TTF-1 immunoreactivity  there is a small percentage that is nonresponsive to this antigen.  A lung adenocarcinoma is favored.  The initial information has been telephonically discussed with Karen Wesenberg  M.D. on February 10  2009.  JAO:mgh:mjv
BRAIN  CEREBELLUM  BIOPSIES (PARTS A AND B):1.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma  consistent with origin from lung primary source.
A)  RIGHT LOWER LOBE NODULE:  Received fresh for a frozen section diagnosis labeled Gaillard  George Joseph  is an 8 x 5.5 x 3 cm wedge biopsy of lung tissue which reveals a surgically stapled margin of resection.  The pleura is inked and the specimen is sectioned to reveal two well-circumscribed gray-white tumor masses measuring 0.5 and 1.8 cm in greatest dimension which appear to approximate the overlying inked pleura by 0.5 cm and the stapled parenchymal margin of resection by 1 cm.  The remaining lung tissue appears unremarkable.  The stapled margin of resection nearest the masses is embedded for a frozen section diagnosis; additional sections are submitted  including the remainder of the en face stapled/parenchymal margin of resection.FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:  STAPLED MARGIN IS EXTENSIVELY POSITIVE FOR ADENOCARCINOMA CONSISTENT WITH METASTATIC DISEASE.

A) 11R LYMPH NODE:  A solitary lymph node is recovered and this shows anthracosis  but there is no evidence of metastatic neoplasm.B) RIGHT LOWER LOBE:  Review of the frozen section slides and a slide prepared from the previously frozen tissue block demonstrates cross sections of bronchus that are negative for metastatic carcinoma.  An included parabronchial lymph node shows anthracosis  but is negative for metastatic disease.  The vascular margin on B2 is found to be negative for neoplasm.  B3 through B5 demonstrate the staple line and these sections all demonstrate benign lung tissue with some included visceral pleura.  Subpleural fibrosis and aggregates of lymphocytes are noted.  Focal reactive changes are noted in the visceral pleura which is somewhat thickened.  Avulsed visceral pleura is noted on slide B6  but again there is no neoplasm present. The included lung tissue is well aerated and shows no active inflammation. B7 through B10 demonstrate the mass.  This is an infiltrating  moderately differentiated pulmonary adenocarcinoma characterized by neoplastic glands that are present in a reactive fibrous stroma.  The malignant glands are composed of epithelial cells with large pleomorphic nuclei.  These display coarse chromatin  irregular nuclear membranes  and prominent nucleoli.  Abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm is present.  Tumor is noted surrounding pulmonary arteries and bronchi.  Foci of vascular invasion are not identified.  In many fields  there is a rather abrupt transition between neoplasm and aerated lung  but in some fields there is a lepidic growth pattern with malignant cells streaming out along the native alveolar septa.  Slide B11 demonstrates irregular fibrous adhesions  but these are uninvolved by neoplasm.  The subjacent lung tissue shows mild emphysematous change.B12 shows a focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage  but there is no neoplasm present.  Additional intraparenchymal hemorrhage is noted on B13 as is a broad zone of thickened visceral pleura.B14 includes three lymph nodes  two of which are peribronchial.  These are all found to be negative for metastatic carcinoma.C) 2R LYMPH NODES:  Three lymph nodes are recovered and these are stained with hematoxylin and eosin and with an immunohistochemical reagent for cytokeratin AE1/AE3.  The nodes are all found to be negative for metastatic carcinoma.D) 3R LYMPH NODES:  Three lymph nodes are recovered and these are stained with hematoxylin and eosin and with an immunohistochemical reagent for cytokeratin AE1/AE3.  The nodes are all found to be negative for metastatic carcinoma.E) 4R LYMPH NODES:  Four lymph nodes are recovered and all are found to be negative for metastatic carcinoma.  The sections have been stained with both hematoxylin and eosin and an anticytokeratin reagent.
20-GAUGE LEFT LUNG CORE:1.  Positive for adenocarcinoma  pending for special stains.
20-GAUGE LEFT LUNG CORES:1.  Adenocarcinoma.2.  Additional immunostain pending.
LUNG  BIOPSY:1.  Metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma  see comment.  COMMENT:  The biopsy shows the presence of nests of epithelial elements with inconspicuous nucleoli and relatively abundant cytoplasm.  Only rare mitotic figures are identified.  The performed immunohistochemical stains demonstrate that the neoplastic elements are positive for Cam 5.2  PSA  racemase  and show focal positivity for PSAP.  Stains for neuroendocrine markers (CD56  synaptophysin  chromogranin) and stains for bcl-2  Villin  CDX-2  keratin 7 and keratin 20 are negative.  The presence of minimal weak and focal  positivity for TTF-1  a finding in this context of unclear significance  is noted.   The proliferative index  estimated by a stain for ki-67  is low.  In summary  these findings are consistent  in particular in view of the strong positivity for PSA  with involvement by a metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma despite the unusual neuroendocrine-like morphological pattern of growth of the neoplasm.  Of note  these results replace and amend the original preliminary diagnosis of                                                                                                    low grade neuroendocrine neoplasm                                                                                                   . Case seen in consultation with Dr. S. Rosenheim  who concurs with the above interpretation.
LIVER MASSES:1.  Metastatic  poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma  favor lung primary (see comment).COMMENT:  Sections demonstrate three cores of liver tissue; one of them is diffusely infiltrated by sheets of poorly differentiated carcinoma with focal glandular differentiation.  The neoplastic cells are large with oval to irregular nuclear contours  central prominent nucleoli and moderate to abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Mitoses are easily found.  No mucin production or squamoid differentiation is found.  By histology  the differential diagnosis includes metastatic  poorly differentiated carcinoma or poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma.The subsequent immunostains show the neoplastic cells to be positive for keratin 7  but negative for keratin 20  CDx-2  villin  TTF-1  PSA and hepatocyte marker.  The negativity of the hepatocyte marker essentially rules out the possibility of hepatocellular carcinoma.  The negativity of keratin 20  CDx-2 and villin is not consistent with the immunophenotype of metastatic carcinoma of colorectal origin.  The negative of the PSA rules out the possibility of metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma.  The negativity of TTF-1 neither supports nor completely excludes the possibility of a metastatic pulmonary carcinoma.  While the morphologic findings and the positivity of keratin 7 are most consistent with pulmonary primary  the remote possibility of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma cannot be entirely excluded by histology and immunohistochemical studies alone.  Therefore  clinical and radiographic correlation is needed for complete interpretation.Intradepartmental consultation was performed by Dr. Sidney Rosenheim  who concurs with the diagnosis.
PLEURAL FLUID:  Samples from the pleural fluid are presented on two direct smears  a concentrated slide and two levels of cell block.  The concentrated slide and direct smears are heavily laden with malignant cells having enlarged nuclei  intracytoplasmic vacuolization and arranged in three-dimensional clumps.  The cell block is paucicellular  however  a few scattered malignant-appearing cells are seen.  Immunoperoxidase stains show positivity with TTF-1  CK7  CK 20 and no reactivity for Ber-Ep4. Although lung adenocarcinomas are typically CK7 +/ CK20 -  10% of such tumors do show CK 20 positivity. Given the strong TTF-1 positivity  a lung adenocarcinoma is favored.JAO/mjv
LEFT UPPER LOBE COMPLETION PNEUMONECTOMY:1.  Metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinoma  measuring 1.6 cm in greatest dimension  is identified in one of three hilar lymph nodes (1/3).2.  The metastatic tumor is 2.0 cm from the inked bronchial margin and does not involve the pleural surface.3.  The non-neoplastic lung tissue shows mild emphysema.COMMENT:  The metastatic adenocarcinoma nearly totally replaces one of three hilar lymph nodes.  Histologically  the metastatic adenocarcinoma is similar to the poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma noted in the previous left lower lobe resection specimen (SP-06-13707).  To confirm the diagnosis and to rule out the remote possibility of metastatic tumor from another region  a panel of immunohistochemical studies was performed and shows the metastatic adenocarcinoma to be positive for keratin 7 and TTF-1  but negative for keratin 20 and cdx-2. The result confirms the morphologic impression of metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinoma.  Clinical and radiographic correlation is recommended for complete interpretation.

Adenocarcinoma  poorly differentiated  most consistent with lung primary  see comment.  COMMENT:  Sections demonstrate involvement of the lung parenchyma by a population of atypical neoplastic epithelial elements arranged focally in the glandular architecture  and immunohistochemically positive for cytokeratin-7 while negative for cytokeratin-20.  A stain for TTF-1 shows focal nuclear positivity.  Stains for PSA  PSAP and cdx-2 are negative.  In summary  these morphological and immunophenotypical findings appear to be most consistent with a lung primary adenocarcinoma.  Case seen in consultation with Sanaa Hussain  M.D.  who concurs with this interpretation.

RIGHT UPPER LUNG WEDGE RESECTION  NODULE:1.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma  consistent with colon primary  maximal tumor dimension 1.7 cm with negative margins.
A) BRONCHIAL WASHING:1.  Inconclusive - Sparse atypical poorly preserved cells - suspicious for a non-small-cell malignancy (see comment).B) BRONCHIAL BRUSHING:1.  Negative for cytologically malignant cells.COMMENT:  The rare atypical large cells in Part A are difficult to classify due to poor preservation  however  a non-small cell carcinoma cannot be ruled out.  These cells lack a thick nuclear membrane  but there is some superimposed degenerative change.  Given the fact that the patient has a prior history of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma involving biopsies from the right upper lobe of the lung (see SN08-1217)  then a non-small-cell carcinoma is a consideration in the differential diagnosis  but additional biopsy or cytology material is recommended to render a more definitive diagnosis.CONSULTATION (PARTS A AND B):  Sanaa Hussain  M.D.  pulmonary pathologist.
A)  RIGHT UPPER LOBE FROZEN SECTION:  Specimen A  which is received fresh for frozen section labeled Randall  Diane Mae  consists of a lung wedge that measures 11.7 x 3.0 x 2.4 cm.  The specimen has a curvilinear staple line that has a length of 13.3 cm.  The pleural surface is pink-tan and smooth  and has been previously excised to expose a gray-white  firm  well-circumscribed mass that appears to abut the pleural surface and come within 0.5 cm from the staple line.  The mass measures 0.8 x 1.1 x 1.5 cm.  A representative section of the mass is taken for frozen section.FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:  ADENOCARCINOMA; MARGIN NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY BY GROSS ASSESSMENT  4-5 MM.  (PHH)The wedge is further sectioned to reveal a 0.3 cm gray-white  firm nodule that is approximately 0.5 cm from the previously described mass and comes within 0.5 cm from the staple line.  Sectioning also reveals a 0.8 cm gray-white  well-circumscribed nodule that comes within 0.6 cm from the first-described mass and 0.5 cm from the resection margin.

LUNG  LEFT POSTERIOR  BIOPSIES:1.  Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma involving fibrous tissue.
THORACENTESIS FLUID:  The cell block sections  direct smears and cytospin smear contain numerous large  atypical cells distributed individually and in small crowded and disorderly solid  micropapillary and tubuloacinar appearing clusters with central lumens.  Some cells show prominent cytoplasmic vacuolization with peripheral displacement and molding of the nuclei.  The atypical cells have relatively large  rounded or ovoid nuclei with small to moderately prominent nucleoli and chromocenters.  There are numerous histiocytes showing positive immunostaining for CD 68 antigen  but relatively few mesothelials and small lymphocytes in the background.  The atypical cells in the cell block section show positive immunostaining for cytokeratin 7 and are focally positive for Ber-Ep4  Leu M1 and CEA adenocarcinoma antigens  They  also show extensive nuclear immunostaining for WT-1 antigen characteristically occurring in serus ovarian carcinomas.  They show negative immunostaining for cytokeratins 5/6  calretinin and D2-40  antigens occurring in mesotheliomas. negative immunostaining for cytokeratin 20  villin and cdx-2 antigens occurring in colorectal and some pancreatic tumors  negative immunostaining for TTF-1 occurring in most adenocarcinomas of the lung and negative immunostaining for estrogen receptor antigen frequently occurring in tumors of the breast  ovary and endometrium.No intracellular or extracellular mucins are identified in the mucicarmine stain.  The cells show focal weak staining for neutral and acid mucopolysaccharides in the PAS-diastase and alcian blue stains.

Leiomyosarcoma (see microscopic description and comment).COMMENT:  The H&E differential diagnosis for this malignant spindle cell malignancy included leiomyosarcoma  gastrointestinal stromal tumor  adrenal cortical carcinoma  hepatocellular carcinoma  metastatic spindle cell carcinoma (of kidney  lung or other origins)  metastatic spindle cell melanoma  mesothelioma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.  The initial round of immunohistochemical stains excluded adrenal cortical carcinoma based on the lack of staining for synaptophysin  melan A  calretinin and inhibin.  Hepatocellular carcinoma was excluded on the basis of negative low molecular weight keratin CAM 5.2 and negative HepPar stains.  Metastatic spindle cell carcinoma was excluded on the basis of negative keratin AE1/AE3 and low molecular weight keratin CAM 5.2 stains; additionally  negative RCC and negative CD10 stains argued against renal cell carcinoma origin and negative TTF-1 argued against adenocarcinoma of lung origin.  Spindle cell melanoma was excluded on the basis of multiple negative melanoma-associated markers such as S100  melan A  HMB-45 and tyrosinase.  Mesothelioma was excluded on the basis of multiple negative mesothelial-associated markers such as calretinin  cytokeratin 5/6 and WT-1.  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor was excluded on the basis of negative S100 and negative p75 stains.  After the initial round of immunohistochemical stains  the differential diagnosis included leiomyosarcoma versus gastrointestinal stromal tumor.  H-caldesmon was positive; however  this stain can be positive in either leiomyosarcoma or gastrointestinal stromal tumor.  However  the negative CD117  CD34 and BCL2 would argue against a gastrointestinal stromal tumor.  The positive calponin  smooth muscle actin and desmin staining in block A2  combined with the previous positive staining for smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and smooth muscle HHF-35 in block A3  would support smooth muscle origin for this spindle cell neoplasm.  The increased mitotic rate (with corresponding high mib-1 activity) and cytologic atypia would support the interpretation of leiomyosarcoma based on these detached small needle core biopsy fragments.

LUNG  RIGHT  CORE BIOPSY:1.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with colon primary  see comment. COMMENT:  Morphologically  the metastatic tumor is similar to the patient's prior resection specimen  SV-05-18804  which is reviewed.
A)  ABDOMINAL WALL SCAR:  Section A1 contains pieces of fibrous peritoneum  deep fascia  a small amount of attached fat.  The fibrous tissues are extensively infiltrated by a sclerosing poorly differentiated carcinoma comprised of solid nests and strands of large atypical cells with moderate amounts of amphophilic cytoplasm and smoothly rounded or ovoid euchromatic nuclei with small nucleoli.  The cells show moderately increased mitotic activity.  Tumor appears to be confined to the peritoneal and deep fascial tissue without invasion of the fat.  B)  OMENTAL BIOPSY:  Frozen section FSCB1 contains pieces of lobulated adipose tissue showing an extensive area of involvement by sclerosing poorly differentiated carcinoma similar to that described above.  The tumor involves a portion of the serosal surface invades lymphovascular spaces.  C)  LEFT OVARY:  Frozen section control FSCC1 and sections C2 and C3 contain left ovarian tissues showing extensive invasion by sclerosing poorly differentiated carcinoma with solid nests  sheets and strands of atypical cells sometimes showing central necrosis.  Some cystic or cavitated areas lined by tumor show slight papillary surface irregularity  but no tubuloglandular arrangements of cells are noted. Tumor focally involves the ovarian serosal surface and involves scattered lymphatics in the ovary and mesovarium  but does not invade the fallopian tube in these sections.  D)  CERVIX  UTERUS  RIGHT OVARY AND FALLOPIAN TUBE  UPPER VAGINA AND RECTAL SIGMOID COLON:  Section D1-D3 contain a pieces of right ovarian tissue with corpora albicantia and cysts  partly lined by tumor cells.  The tissues are infiltrated by nests and strands of sclerosing poorly differentiated non-mucinous carcinoma with areas of central necrosis.  There is multifocal involvement of the ovarian serosal surface by tumor. No portions of the right fallopian tube are identified in these sections.  Section D4 contains three pieces of anterior vaginal wall and mucosa with a blue-inked deep surface.  Multiple submucosal and deep lymphatics near the blue-inked deep surface are involved by tumor.  The vaginal squamous mucosa shows no evident dysplasia.  Section D5 designated anterior serosa contains pieces of fibrous and fibromuscular tissue with scattered areas of invasive tumor and additional lymphatic involvement.

20-GAUGE CORE  RIGHT LUNG MASS:1.  Adenocarcinoma.Comment:  TTF-1 staining is pending.
LYMPH NODE  PARA-AORTIC  BIOPSY:1.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma  consistent with pancreatic primary origin (see comment).COMMENT:  The patient has a recent fine needle aspiration of the pancreas (NP-08-2071) from October of 2008 which was interpreted as positive for cytologically malignant cells derived from adenocarcinoma.  The current lymph node biopsy shows a metastatic adenocarcinoma.  The immunohistochemical profile of focally positive cytokeratin 7 and negative cytokeratin 20 can be seen in primary tumors of lung and upper GI carcinoma origin as well as mesothelioma.  Negative calretinin stain argues against mesothelial origin.  Negative TTF-1 argues against pulmonary origin.  Positive villin supports origin from an upper gastrointestinal tract origin  including pancreaticobiliary carcinoma.  Negative HepPar argues against a hepatocellular carcinoma.  Positive cytokeratin 19 is typically seen in pancreatic adenocarcinomas and would argue against gastric origin.In conclusion  the histologic features  immunohistochemical profile and clinical history would support that the current case represents metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with a pancreatic primary source.

The tumor measures up to 8.0 mm in the tissue sections  but due to its involvement of three sequential tissue sections probably exceeds 10 mm.  The intraluminal tumor and tumor cells lining the cyst near the site of perforation extend to within 0.5 mm from the pleural surface.  The tumor shows  lepidic growth with one or more layers of large atypical cells in disorderly arrangements lining the cyst and pericystic alveolar septa.  The cyst wall is dystrophically calcified.  The tumor cells are pleomorphic with moderate to abundant amounts of non-vacuolated  pale amphophilic cytoplasm and relatively large  irregularly rounded nuclei with prominent nucleoli.  No lymphovascular invasion is identified.  The tumor cells show positive immunostaining for TTF-1 and cytokeratin 7 antigens  with negative immunostaining for cytokeratin 20 antigen.  This immunophemotype is characteristic of primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma.

LUNG  BIOPSY:1.  Mucinous adenocarcinoma (see comment).COMMENT:  The core biopsy demonstrates the presence of nests of epithelial elements forming glandular structures and characterized by hyperchromatic large pleomorphic nuclei and a mucinous appearing cytoplasm.  The neoplastic elements are entrapped in a fibrosclerotic stroma.  The performed immunohistochemical stains demonstrate that the neoplastic cells have a CK7+ phenotype  while are negative for CK20  TTF-1 and CDX-2.  The findings  although nonspecific  are compatible with a lung  primary.  Correlation with the clinical findings is recommended.CONSULTATION:  Sanaa Hussain  M.D.

MIDLINE NECK LESION  FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION:  The cell block section contains fragments of hypercellular tissue containing a generally monomorphous population of intermediate size atypical cells with high N:C ratios and small to moderate amounts of nonvacuolated  nonkeratinized amphophilic cytoplasm.  The cell nuclei are irregularly rounded and vesicular with one or more prominent nucleoli and smaller chromocenters.  A few atypical mitoses are noted.  The cells are loosely cohesive and do not form tubuloglandular appearing arrangements.  The atypical cells show positive immunostaining for leukocyte common antigen (CD45) which is a marker for lymphomas and other hematopoietic malignancies and more than 90% of the cells show positive immunostaining for Ki-67 nuclear proliferation antigen consistent with a high grade tumor.  The atypical cells also show positive nuclear immunostaining for p63 antigen occurring in a wide range of epithelial tumors and in some large cell lymphomas.  The atypical cells are negative for CD 20  CD 79a  and PAX 5 B-cell lymphoma antigens  CD 3 pan T-cell antigens and for CD34 precursor myeloid cell antigen.  They are weakly positive for CD117 myeloid stem cell antigen.  The cells show negative immunostaining for  epithelial pancytokeratins AE1/AE3  CK5/6  CK7  CK20 occurring in squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinomas  Ber EP-4 adenocarcinoma antigen  p504s and PSA  antigens occurring in prostatic adenocarcinoma  melan-a melanoma antigen  and TTF-1 antigen occurring in some non-small carcinomas of lung.The cytospin smear also contains a generally monomorphous population of atypical small to intermediate size cells with scant to small amounts of cytoplasm and irregularly rounded nuclei with small to moderately conspicuous nucleoli.  A small proportion of of these cells form cohesive groups with crowded and overlapped cell nuclei.  The direct smears contain small to moderate numbers of discohesive small to intermediate size lymphoid cells showing similar cytologic atypia.  FDC/mjv

LUNG CORE BIOPSIES:1.  Positive for adenocarcinoma and suggestive of bronchoalveolar subtype.
THREE 20-GAUGE CORE LUNG SAMPLES IN FORMALIN:1.  Well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with bronchoalveolar features.Comment:  This case was reviewed at the Daily Intradepartmental QA Conference.
A)  RIGHT LOWER LOBE WEDGE RESECTION:  The specimen is labeled David Franzel.  It is received fresh for intraoperative consultation by frozen section and is a 16.9 gram pulmonary wedge which is 8.5 x 5.2 x 1.3 cm.  A wire suture line runs along one edge of the specimen.  Prior to sectioning  the entire specimen is stained with blue dye.  The pleural surfaces are smooth.  On serial section  the specimen contains a 1.1 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm pale yellow-tan nodule found 1 cm from the nearest wire suture line.  The overlying pleura is smooth and does not appear to be involved. The remaining cut surfaces are homogeneous and the specimen is crepitant throughout.  No other abnormality is identified. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:  FAVOR ATYPICAL CARCINOID VS. ADENOCARCINOMA - DEFER TO PERMANENTS FOR FURTHER CHARACTERIZATION (MCF/CONSULT:ARS)SECTIONS:A1)  a section of the nodule submitted after frozen section;A2)  the remainder of the nodule;A3)-A4)  random representative sections.B)  RIGHT LOWER LOBE:  The specimen is labeled David Eli Franzel.  It is received in formalin and is a 190 gram apparent right lower lobe which is 17.5 x 10.5 x 6.5 cm.  Four wire suture lines are found.  Two are parallel at the hilum and are 4.5 cm and 2 cm in length.  An additional suture line is 5 cm in length and is found over the superior part of the lobe.  The last and longest is found extending from the hilum inferiorly for a length of 10 cm.  Prior to sectioning  each of these wire suture lines are stained with blue dye.  The longer wire suture line at the hilum runs over the bronchovascular margin making a section of this margin quite difficult as this suture line is dissected off of the hilar margin.  A structure consistent with tumor bulges out from the apparent mainstem bronchus.  The tumor is 1.5 x 1.4 x 0.6 cm.  This tumor appears to press on the adjacent pulmonary vasculature.  Peripheral to the central hilar structures  there are additional large caliber vessels which are received stapled close.  These are grossly free of tumor involvement.  The bronchi are dissected.  No other gross lesions are identified.  The recognizable lymph nodes are anthracotic.  Calcified lymph nodes are not recognized. Multiple representative sections are submitted.

The microscopic examination show tumor foci in the fibroadipose tissue of the parietal pleura but not on the inked margin in areas where the tissue is not fragmented .  However  in fragmented areas the tumor cells appear at the ink and on the surface.  Clinical and radiological correlation is recommended to accurately determine the extent of involvement.COMMENT: Drs. Handy and Shaumberg notified with the preliminary results on 8/28/08.NOTE: Due to the non-specific immunostain profile  this case will be sent out for consultation and an addendum will follow.
LEFT LOWER LOBE BIOPSY:1.  Poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma (see comment).COMMENT:  The morphologic findings are those of a poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma.  No ductal formation  squamoid or glandular differentiation is noted in the biopsy.  The immunostains show the neoplastic cells to be positive for pankeratin  keratin 7  E-cadherin  and CEA   but negative for TTF-1  keratin 5/6  and breast markers (ER  PR  BRST-2  mammaglobin).  The negativity of TTF-1 neither supports nor completely excludes the possibility of poorly differentiated carcinoma of lung primary.  The negativity of breast markers neither supports nor completely excludes the possibility of metastatic poorly differentiated breast carcinoma. The positivity of E-cadherin indicates that the metastatic carcinoma is not likely to be a lobular carcinoma of breast as it is always negative for E-cadherin. The positivity of CEA may suggest poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  In summary  the immunostaining pattern is nonspecific  but the differential diagnosis should include poorly differentiated metastatic breast ductal carcinoma  metastatic carcinoma from upper GI  head/neck or other sites  and primary carcinoma of lung.  Clinical and radiographic correlation is recommended for complete interpretation.The FISH analysis for Her-2/Neu is pending.Intradepartmental consultation was performed by Dr. Sanaa Hussain  a Pulmonary Pathologist.

LEFT LOWER LOBE NODULE:  The sections contain a piece of partly atelectatic lung tissue and a fragment of peribronchial lymph node tissue encompassing some peribronchial mucous glands.  There is an adjacent small piece of bronchial mucosa  showing severe epithelial dysplasia with a subepithelial solid group of large atypical cells consistent with invasive non-small cell carcinoma.. These cells have moderate to abundant non-vacuolated  non-keratinized cytoplasm and large irregularly rounded or occasionally angulated nuclei with inconspicuous nuclei and numerous cytoplasmic intranuclear pseudo inclusions.  The atypical cells are positive for cytokeratin 7 and negative for cytokeratin 20 consistent with a non-small cell bronchogenic carcinoma  but the cells are negative for TTF-1 antigen occurring in most poorly differentiated non-small cell bronchogenic carcinomas.  The cells are negative for cytokeratins 5/6 usually present in  squamous carcinomas.  A few atypical cells show weakly positive immunostaining for Ber-EP4 adenocarcinoma antigen..  The remaining lung tissues contain a fewl patchy interstitial lymphoid aggregates but show no additional inflammation or any atypical cellular infiltrates..

A) SUPRAPANCREATIC LYMPH NODE:  Frozen section control FSCA1 contains a cross section of a large lymph node showing no involvement with metastatic tumor.B) NEW PANCREATIC MARGIN:  Frozen section control FSCB1 contains a piece of pancreatic tissue with some peripancreatic fat.  The pancreatic tissues are uninflamed and have a normal lobular architecture with a few small areas of glandular atrophy and fibrosis.  No invasive tumor is identified.C) GALLBLADDER:  Section C1 contains a strip of gallbladder wall and mucosa and two cross sections of cystic duct.  The gallbladder mucosal  submucosal and interstitial tissues are sparsely infiltrated by small numbers of lymphoid cells.  No acute inflammatory cells are noted.  The tissues show no glandular epithelial dysplasia or involvement by metastatic tumor.D) PARTIAL STOMACH  PANCREAS AND DUODENUM:  Frozen section control FSCD1 contains pancreatic tissue from the surgical margin of the uncinate process.  No invasive tumor is identified.  Frozen section control FSCD2 contains a cross section of the common bile duct margin and a periductal lymph node showing no involvement by tumor.  Sections D3 and D4 contain full-thickness pieces of gastric wall and mucosa from the proximal gastric surgical margin showing no involvement by tumor.  Section D5 contains full-thickness pieces of the duodenal wall and mucosa at the distal surgical margin resection showing no involvement by tumor.  D6 through D8 contain additional full-thickness pieces of gastric wall and mucosa  including the gastroduodenal junction with some adjacent portions of the pancreas in section D8.  The pancreatic tissues include a portion of the pancreatic duct and an area of pancreatic atrophy and fibrosis with partial to complete loss of the acinar epithelium and residual groups of small normal ducts.  No ductal epithelial dysplasia or invasive pancreatic tumor is identified.  Sections D9 and D10 contain pieces of duodenal wall and mucosa including the ampulla and some adjacent pancreatic tissue.  The ampullary submucosa and periampullary tissues are invaded by poorly differentiated carcinoma which partly encompasses the intramural common bile duct.  There is partial ulceration of the overlying ampullary and bile duct mucosal surfaces which are inflamed  but do not show any associated glandular epithelial dysplasia.  The tumor has a maximum span of about 10 mm in the tissue sections and invades the wall of the common bile duct.  The surrounding pancreatic tissues show variably extensive atrophy and fibrosis but are not invaded by the tumor.  The pancreatic duct in this area show no evident dysplasia or involvement by tumor.  The tumor is comprised of large pleomorphic cells in solid nested and trabecular arrangements with only occasional formation of rudimentary tubuloacinar appearing structures having small central lumens.  The tumor cells have generally abundant pale eosinophilic or amphophilic cytoplasm with distinct cytoplasmic borders and predominantly small rounded or ovoid euchromatic nuclei with small to moderately prominent nucleoli.  A few larger and more pleomorphic show greater nucleolar prominence.  There are numerous atypical mitoses.  The tumor cells show for positive immunostaining for cytokeratins AE1/AE3  5/6 and  p63 antigens usually present in squamous cell and transitional urothelial cell carcinomas  but are also positive for cytokeratin 7 usually negative in squamous carcinoma and negative for CD117 antigen occurring in 60% of transitional urothelial cell carcinoma.  They are negative Ber-EP4 adenocarcinoma antigen  and negative for cytokeratin 20  villin and cdx-2 antigens occurring in virtually all small intestinal and colorectal adenocarcinomas and in some pancreatic  gallbladder and cholangiocarcinomas.  The tumor cells are negative for estrogen receptor antigen occurring in endometrial and ovarian serous carcinomas and are additionally negative for BRST-2 antigen occurring in some breast carcinomas.  The cells are negative for TTF-1 antigen antigen occurring in most poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinomas of the lung and are negative for melan-A and S-100 protein melanoma antigens.  This immunophenotype is diagnostically inconclusive.Sections D11 through D21 contain pancreatic tissues proceeding from the from surgical margin through the head of the pancreas showing no involvement by invasive tumor.  The pancreatic tissues exhibit areas of glandular atrophy and fibrosis predominantly involving the loss of acinar epithelium with preservation of the small pancreatic ducts.  There is no ductal epithelial dysplasia.  The peripancreatic tissues are not involved by tumor.  A small peripancreatic lymph node in section D18 is negative for metastatic tumor.  Sections D22 through D33 contain twenty-three peripancreatic lymph nodes showing no involvement by metastatic tumor.  Section D34 contains a perigastric lymph node showing no involvement by metastatic tumor.  (nm)

LUNG  LEFT UPPER LOBE  CORE NEEDLE BIOPSY:1.  Adenocarcinoma of lung primary.
LUNG MASS  TUMOR? (CAVITARY):  The sections contain pieces of necrotic cellular material bordered by a few solid groups of large  rounded or polygonal cells with moderate to abundant amounts of non-vacuolated  non-keratinized cytoplasm and well-defined cytoplasmic borders.  The cells have relatively large  rounded or ovoid  diffusely hyperchromatic nuclei with generally inconspicuous nucleoli.  The  groups of atypical cells contain a few necrotic single cells with some additional atypical cells embedded in the adjacent necrotic cellular material.  The atypical cells show positive immunostaining for cytokeratins 5/6 and nuclear  P63 antigens.  They are negative for cytokeratins 7 and 20.  This immunophenotype is characteristic of squamous carcinoma. The cells are negative for TTF-1 antigen occurring in about 60% of poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinomas of the lung  negative for BerEP-4 adenocarcinoma antigen and negative for CD163 histiocyte antigen.
SKIN OF THE RIGHT SHOULDER (1.1 X 0.8 X 0.4 CM BIOPSY):1.  Adenocarcinoma involving the dermis  lesion extends to the margins of excision.COMMENT:  The morphologic pattern within the dermis is consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma (no definitive connection with epidermis or adnexa identified  apparent focal lymphatic involvement).  The immunohistochemistry marker pattern is not specific.  The CK7 positive/CK20 negative/EMA positive/CEA positive profile is consistent with an adenocarcinoma arising in the lung.  The overall staining pattern is not compelling for prostate or lower GI origin.  Pancreas  biliary tree and other sites cannot be ruled out with any certainty.  Clinical correlation is likely to yield optimal identification of the primary site of origin of this apparent adenocarcinoma metastatic to the skin.Interpreted by James B. Durham  M.D.  Board Certified in Dermatopathology
AXILLA  MASS  BIOPSY:1.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma extensively replacing lymph node with extranodal tumor extension (see microscopic description and comment).COMMENT: The patient has a previous clinical history on Physician Portal of lung cancer with metastases. The patient had a prior mediastinal lymph node sampling in 2006 (SP-06-5993) with metastatic adenocarcinoma present in several lymph nodes at that time. The current axillary biopsy shows metastatic adenocarcinoma extensively replacing a lymph node with extranodal tumor extension identified. In the current case  the absence of staining for villin or cdx-2 would argue against an upper GI primary source. TTF-1 stain is negative  which does not exclude a lung adenocarcinoma primary origin  and the presence of staining for monoclonal CEA would support a lung primary over a breast primary source. For completeness  a block from the 2006 case (SP-06-5993 block F1) is stained and shows strongly positive cytokeratin 7  rare positive cells on cytokeratin 20  negative TTF-1  negative estrogen receptor and strongly positive CEA-monoclonal; this immunohistochemical profile in the 2006 case is similar to that seen in the current axillary specimen.In summary  the findings in the metastatic adenocarcinoma in the current axillary case and prior mediatinal case show a similar immunohistochemical profile and the findings fit best with a lung adenocarcinoma primary source. The male sex of the patient is noted; however  for completeness  clinical correlation to exclude a breast lesion would be helpful  given the axillary lymph node site of involvement in the current biopsy.
LUNG CORES:  Sections reveal multiple lung tissue corse with involvement of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with extensive necrosis.  Immunostaining reveal the tumor cells are positive for Keratin 5/6 and p63 and negative for TTF1. The mucicarmine stain is also negative. The findings are suggestive of a squamous cell carcinoma.

LYMPH NODE FRAGMENTS (LEFT POSTERIOR CERVICAL)  PS-08-4365  6/30/08:1.  Poorly-differentiated metastatic carcinoma with abundant necrosis  see comment.COMMENT:  This case was reviewed at the Daily Intradepartmental QA Conference. We agree that the immunohistochemical studies are not entirely specific and do not point to a particular site of origin.  The expression of BER-EP4 confirms that it is an adenocarcinoma and  with the strong expression of cytokeratin 7 with a lesser degree of cytokeratin 20  the immunoprofile would favor a pulmonary metastasis and less likely a colorectal metastasis.  Although the TTF-1 is negative  adenocarcinoma of pulmonary primary can occasionally be negative.  The p63 stain is negative  which excludes squamous differentiation.  Lastly  the HepPar1 is negative  which tends to exclude a hepatocellular metastasis.  Overall  the differential would include lung or possibly an upper GI tract/pancreatic primary  but we concur with the opinion that a lung metastasis is favored.
LUNG  RIGHT  UPPER AND LOWER LOBES  BIOPSIES:1.  Invasive adenocarcinoma  poorly differentiated  involving the submitted biopsies  see comment.

LUNG  RIGHT UPPER LOBE  ENDOBRONCHIAL BIOPSIES:1.  Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma involving submitted biopsies.
A)  SEGMENT 7 LIVER BIOPSY:  Frozen section control FSCA1 contains a fragmented thin needle core biopsy segment of tumor tissue resembling abnormal hepatic tissue containing trabecular groups of atypical hepatocytes showing abnormal variation in size and shape with a predominance of the smaller cells.  The cells are rounded or polygonal with well defined cytoplasmic borders.  Intercellular bile canaliculi are difficult to identify.  Nuclear:cytoplasmic ratios are generally increased with irregularly rounded or occasionally ovoid hyperchromatic nuclei having generally small nucleoli and rare cytoplasmic intranuclear inclusions.  One atypical mitotic figure is noted.  No Mallory's hyaline is noted.  There are no portal areas or bile ducts..  B)  LIVER BIOPSY:  Section B1 contains a piece of liver tissue showing no involvement by tumor.  The tissues appear architecturally normal with a few portal areas showing slightly increased lymphocytic infiltration  but no piecemeal periportal necrosis  lobular inflammation or increased portal fibrosis. There are scattered areas of mild steatosis.  C)  CORE NEEDLE BIOPSY OF TUMOR:  Section C1 contains larger needle core biopsy segments of an hepatocellular carcinoma having broad trabecular sheets and nests of more severely atypical hepatocytes sometimes bordered by sinusoidal endothelium.  These tumor cells show greater variation in size and shape with a predominance of the smaller cells. The N:C ratios are generally increased with small to moderately prominent nucleoli and numerous atypical mitoses.  No Mallory's hyaline is identified.  The tumor contains scattered areas of inflammation and occasional fibrosis  but no bile ducts.  Intercellular bile canaliculi are difficult to identify.  The tumor cells show positive immunostaining for Heppar-1  low molecular weight cytokeratin Cam 5.2  and cell membrane or pericanalicular immunostaining  polyclonal CEA antigens characteristic of hepatocellular carcinoma.  The cells show negative immunostaining for alpha-fetoprotein occurring in a minority of hepatocellular carcinomas and are negative for cytokeratin 7 and Ber-EP4 adenocarcinoma antigens usually present in cholangiocarcinoma and metastatic breast carcinoma.  The cells are negative for TTF-1 antigen occurring in most metastatic non-small cell lung carcinomas and for cytokeratin 20 typically occurring in metastatic colorectal carcinomas.  The immunophenotype of these cells is entirely consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma.

TWO CORES  18 GAUGE  LIVER BIOPSY:  There are two cores of liver parenchyma exhibiting neoplasm at one pole.  The tumor forms solid irregular anastomosing cords of large cells with high N:C ratios  one to three small nucleoli  ill-defined pink cytoplasm and frequent mitoses.  There is some fibrous tissue between these cords and large areas of necrosis.  Occasional lymphocytes and plasma cells are scattered in the stroma.  Away from the neoplasm the hepatic parenchyma shows mild anisokaryosis  unremarkable sinusoids and sparse lymphocytes in the portal triads without piecemeal necrosis.  Bile ductules are lined by normal cuboidal epithelia without bile stasis.  Lipofuscin pigment is scattered in the hepatocytes.  IMMUNOPEROXIDASE STAIN RESULTS:  A battery of immunoperoxidase stains was performed on block A1.  The results show that the tumor is strongly positive with cytokeratin 7 and has a markedly elevated mib-1 of greater than 70% nuclear staining.  Also  there is weak positivity with BerEP-4.  The tumor is negative with the neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin  chromogranin and negative with the melanoma markers S-100  HMB-45  and negative with the gastrointestinal markers of villin and CDX2.  The pulmonary and thyroid marker  TTF-1  is negative.  The tumor is negative with Heppar  the hepatocyte marker  helping to exclude hepatoma.  The tumor is negative with cytokeratin 20  RCC (renal cell marker) and estrogen receptor.  Given the results of these special stains  and especially the positive cytokeratin 7 and negative cytokeratin 20  the differential diagnosis would include breast carcinoma  lung carcinoma  ovarian serous carcinoma  endometrial adenocarcinoma  mesothelioma  thymoma  and upper gastrointestinal carcinoma (including bile duct carcinoma or pancreaticobiliary type).   A mammaglobin  BRST-2  and calretinin were ordered  but could NOT be performed due to exhaustion of the tissue block.Following intramural consultation from Dr. Jeffrey D. Harter  he concurs with the differential diagnoses.  The weakly staining BerEP-4 favors a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma  despite a negative mucicarmine result.SPECIAL STAIN RESULTS:  The last battery of immunoperoxidase stains included cytokeratin-903 and monoclonal CEA  recommended by Dr. Harter.  The neoplasm has a few cells weakly positive with cytokeratin 903 and the monoclonal CEA is strongly positive in the neoplasm.  In concert with the positive BerEP-4  this suggests that the tumor is an adenocarcinoma.  A mucicarmine stain performed on block A1 is negative for mucin production.  The control slide worked appropriately.  The histology laboratory used a previously stained glass slide to do the mucicarmine stain  since the tissue from the block had been exhausted on the previous immunostains.  Histologically  the tumor is not likely to represent thymoma  mesothelioma or ovarian serous carcinoma.  (mgh)

LIVER MASS:  The submitted sections are of two needle core biopsies of fibrous tissue involved by poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in the form of single cells  small clusters and few glands.  The cells have pink cytoplasm  nuclei vary in size and shape  prominent nucleoli and a few atypical mitoses.  Immunohistochemical stains along with appropriate controls are performed on both these recent biopsies and the previous ovarian tumor of (SP03-21654).  The recent biopsies show the tumor cells to be diffusely and strongly positive for CK19  CAM 5.2  CK7 and focally for CEAp and CA125 while being negative WT-1  vimentin  AFP and hepatocyte (hepatocellular stains)  TTF-1 (lung stain)  BRST-2 and ER (breast tumors)  CDX2 and villin (gastrointestinal tract stains) and BRST-3.  The immunostains performed on the previous tumor of the ovary (SP03-21654)  show similar immunoprofile with the tumor cells being positive for CK19; focally positive for CEAp and CA125 and negative for WT-1 and ER.  Although WT-1 and ER are considered to be ovarian stains  the high grade of the tumor could be responsible for the negative results.The similar immunoprofiles support the diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma to the liver from ovarian origin.

BREAST  RIGHT  AXILLARY TAIL  NEEDLE CORE BIOPSY:1.  Poorly differentiated carcinoma  consistent with poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal carcinoma of breast origin (see microscopic description and comment).  COMMENT:  The invasive nature of the carcinoma is supported by the lack of staining of a myoepithelial layer on immunohistochemical staining for smooth muscle myosin heavy chain.  Cytokeratin 7 is focally positive  mainly at the periphery of neoplastic cell nests  including areas which show squamoid features.  A similar immunohistochemical pattern is seen with cytokeratin 5/6 and cytokeratin 903.  p63 immunohistochemical stain  however  is diffusely positive in the invasive carcinoma.  Given the location of the tumor and the differing pattern between p63 versus cytokeratin 5/6 and cytokeratin 903  the invasive carcinoma is favored to be of primary breast origin  rather than a metastatic squamous carcinoma.  Positive p63 staining can be seen in invasive carcinomas of breast origin  especially those with high nuclear grade  as seen here.  Also  p63 staining as well as cytokeratin 5/6 and cytokeratin 903 staining with evidence of squamoid features can be seen in metaplastic variants of infiltrating ductal carcinoma of breast origin.  These metaplastic variants of infiltrating ductal carcinoma show a lower percentage of expression for cytokeratin 7 and are cytokeratin 20 negative  which would fit the pattern in this case.  These variants are also typically negative for estrogen receptor  progesterone receptor and mammaglobin  as seen here.  E-cadherin expression  as seen here  would be expected in an infiltrating ductal carcinoma of breast origin.  TTF-1 stain is negative  arguing against metastasis from a lung adenocarcinoma origin.  Negative calretinin staining argues against mesothelial origin for the tumor.  In conclusion  the tumor is an invasive poorly differentiated carcinoma and the histologic features and immunohistochemical profile would be consistent with an infiltrating ductal carcinoma of primary breast origin  with the features favoring a metaplastic variant of this primary breast carcinoma.

SCAPULA MASS:  Sections demonstrate a core of bone and bone marrow tissue.  The bone marrow space is nearly totally replaced by neoplastic glands lined by atypical epithelial cells with increased N:C ratio  prominent nucleoli  and slightly basophilic cytoplasm.  No mucin production is present.  No squamoid differentiation is noted.  Some tumor infiltrating areas show fusion of the neoplastic glands with dense fibrosis or stromal reaction.  The trabecular bone shows mild reactive osteo hyperplasia architecture distortion.Subsequent immunostains were performed to characterized the nature of the neoplasm.  The stains show the neoplastic glands to be positive for pankeratin and PSA  but negative for keratin 7  keratin 20 and CDX-2.  The negativity of keratin 20 and CDX-2 essentially rules out the possibility of metastatic carcinoma of colonic origin.  The negativity of keratin 7 rules out the possibility of metastatic carcinoma of lung primary.  The overall morphologic and immunohistochemical findings are diagnostic for metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma.

LUNG  RIGHT UPPER LOBE  WEDGE RESECTION:1.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma  consistent with primary cervical adenocarcinoma.2.  Tumor does not extend to the pleural surface.3.  No involvement of the stapled margin is seen.Note:  The previous case  SV08-3776  was reviewed  and the tumor morphology is similar to that seen in the previous resection.  Given that a review of the original cervical adenocarcinoma was performed with the previous case and correlated with immunostains  these findings are consistent with a cervical primary.

COMMENT:  The overall features  particularly the immunophenotypic profile of this case are most consistent with an adenocarcinoma of the lung.  However  some morphologic features including papillary architecture  numerous psammoma body type calcifications  and cells with prominent intranuclear inclusions raises the possibility of metastatic papillary carcinoma of the thyroid.  By report  this patient has a history of thyroid surgery but a pathology report from  that specimen is not available at this time.  Correlation is recommended.Pathology Staging Summary*Specimen type:  Left lower lobe*Tumor size:  2.1 cm*Histologic type:  adenocarcinoma*Invasion of:Pleura: *Invasion of visceral pleura:  not identified *Tumor on visceral pleural surface:  not identified**Total lymph nodes:  7      *Number positive (indicate if N1  N2  or N3): 0*Grade:  Well differentiatedVessel Invasion:  *Large vessel invasion (venous):  not identified *Large vessel invasion *(arterial):  not identified Lymphatic invasion:  not identifiedMargins: *Bronchial margin:  n/a *Vascular margin:  n/a *Parenchymal margin (if applicable):  not involved *Parietal pleura/chest wall margin (if applicable):  n/a*AJCC Pathology Stage:  T1N0Mx

 L2 SPINE  18 GAUGE NEEDLE CORE:  Sections demonstrate cartilage and dense fibrous tissue almost completely replaced by a diffusely infiltrating tumor that is characterized by fused groups of cells with small to intermediate nuclei without prominent nucleoli but have a somewhat cohesive appearance but no distinct cell borders are seen.  Scattered mitoses are present.  Immunostains demonstrate that the tumor is positive for keratin 7  CD138  and focal vimentin while negative for keratin 20  S100   HMB45  TTF-1  Renal cell carcinoma stain and BRST-2 (nonspecific nuclear staining seen)  ER  PR  P63  EMA  CD20 and CD3.The CK7 positivity suggests a category of tumors that include lung adenocarcinoma  ovarian nonmucinous carcinoma  endometrial carcinoma  breast carcinoma and mesothelioma. Other possibilities cannot be excluded.Additional stains are being performed to attempt tp further characterize the tumor and will be reported in an addendum.

LUNG  LEFT  20 GAUGE NEEDLE CORE BIOPSY:1.  Pulmonary parenchyma with fibrosis and chronic inflammation and focal involvement by a well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Comment:  This case was reviewed at the Daily Intradepartmental QA Conference.
PLEURAL FLUID:  Samples from the pleural fluid are distributed on two direct smears  a concentrated slide and two levels of cell block.  The sample is highly cellular with clusters of enlarged cells with enlarged nuclei  cytoplasmic vacuolization and prominent nucleoli.  A background of reactive-appearing mesothelial cells admixed with inflammatory cells is seen.  Immunoperoxidase stains are positive for CK 7 and Ber-Ep4  negative for CK 20  claretinin and TTF-1. the pattern is that of adenocarcinoma  typically positive for TTF-1 if derived from a lung primary. A breast or ovarian primary are considered in the differential diagnosis.  JAO/mjv
LUNG  SITE UNSPECIFIED  BIOPSIES:1.  Invasive  moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma involving all submitted biopsies.
BIOPSY  ESOPHAGEAL:  Sections demonstrate multiple small fragments of soft tissue  two of which are diffusely infiltrated by sheets of poorly differentiated carcinoma with marked crush artifact and extensive necrosis.  In relatively preserved areas  the neoplastic cells are intermediate to large in size with round to irregular nuclear contours  smudged or fine chromatin  inconspicuous nucleoli and moderate eosinophilic cytoplasm  consistent with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma.  Adjacent to the tumor or away from the neuroendocrine tumor is moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with neoplastic glands growing in a cribriform pattern and single neoplastic cells infiltrating the surrounding stroma.  In addition  a few fragments of specialized columnar cell mucosa showing irregular glands with goblet cells are consistent with intestinal metaplasia.  No squamous mucosa or squamocolumnar junctional mucosa is present in the biopsy tissue.  The morphologic findings are those of a poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma with focal moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma components.SPECIAL STAIN:  Mucin stain is weakly positive in the adenocarcinoma component  but not in the neuroendocrine carcinoma area.IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRYKeratin AE1/AE3:  positiveKeratin 7:  positive in adenocarcinoma component  but negative in neuroendocrine carcinoma componentKeratin 20:  positive in adenocarcinoma component  but negative in neuroendocrine carcinoma componentCEA-m:  positive in adenocarcinoma component  but negative in neuroendocrine carcinoma componentP63:  negativeCD56:  positive in neuroendocrine carcinoma component  but negative in adenocarcinoma componentSynaptophysin:  positive in neuroendocrine carcinoma component  but negative in adenocarcinoma componentChromogranin:  positive in neuroendocrine carcinoma component  but negative in adenocarcinoma componentTTF-1:  negativeCD45:  focal reactive lymphoid cells and small lymphoid aggregates positiveINTERPRETATION:  Immunohistochemical studies were performed to characterize the nature of the neoplasm.  The stain for pankeratin marks both neuroendocrine carcinoma and moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma; however  keratin 7  keratin 20 and CEA only mark the adenocarcinoma component.  In contrast  the neuroendocrine markers (CD56  synaptophysin and chromogranin) stain strongly positive in the neuroendocrine carcinoma component.  The stain for P63 is negative  arguing against the possibility of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.  The negativity of TTF-1 argues against  but does not entirely exclude  the possibility of metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma of lung primary.  However  the overall morphologic and immunophenotypical findings are most consistent with those of a carcinoma with biphasic and biphenotypical features.
MASS OF LEFT CHEST WALL (3.5 X 3 X 2.3 CM EXCISION):1.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma  see comment.COMMENT:  Neither the combination of H&E histology findings and immunohistochemistry findings nor either the histology or immunohistochemistry findings individually provide a specific diagnosis for the primarysite of this metastatic adenocarcinoma.  Systemic review of this patient is likely to be necessary in order to identify the primary neoplasm.The pattern of CK7 positivity and only focal staining on CK20  despite villin negativity  CDX-2 negativity and TTF-1 negativity  suggests that the primary adenocarcinoma may include lung or upper GI.  Other sites are not excluded in any way by these studies.Dr. Jeff Harter has also reviewed this case and concurs with the diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma.Interpreted by James B.

A)-B)  BRAIN TUMOR  DEEP LEFT FRONTAL:1.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma compatible with lung primary.Comment:  This case was reviewed at the Daily Intradepartmental QA Conference.
LEFT LOWER LUNG BIOPSY:  Section A1 contains a piece of lung tissue showing extensive infiltration by a fragmented  epithelial neoplasm comprised of solid nests and trabecular sheets of large atypical cells having moderate to relatively abundant amounts of nonvacuolated  nonkeratinized cytoplasm with ill defined borders.  The cell nuclei are variably enlarged  rounded  and hyperchromatic with evenly dispersed chromatin and small to moderately prominent nucleoli   There are moderate numbers of atypical mitoses and scattered areas of tumor necrosis.  The tumor cells show positive immunostaining for cytokeratins 5/6 and are negative for cytokeratins 7 and 20 characteristic of squamous carcinoma.  The cells are negative for TTF-1 antigen occurring in most poorly differentiated non-small bronchogenic carcinomas and for Ber Ep4 adenocarcinoma antigen.  They are also negative for synaptophysin and chromogranin neourendocrine tumor antigens.
RIGHT CHEST WALL MASS  LATERAL:1.  Metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma with extensive necrosis  margins clear. COMMENT:  The history of poorly differentiated ductal carcinoma of the right breast  SV06-23662  and well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung  SV07-1300 is noted.  Histologic and immunohistochemical findings in the current lesion are consistent with metastasis/recurrence of the breast tumor. This case was reviewed at the Daily Intradepartmental QA Conference.
LUNG NODULE (NEEDLE CORE BIOPSIES):1.  Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with bronchogenic origin.  CONSULTATION:  Jeffrey D. Harter M.D.
RIGHT CHEST WALL MASS  NEEDLE CORE BIOPSY:1.  Poorly differentiated carcinoma  most consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of pulmonary primary origin (see microscopic description and comment).COMMENT:  The patient's clinical reports are reviewed on Physician Portal.  A chest CT report of February 26th  2008  describes a 3.1 cm mass in the right upper lobe of the lung which was radiologically consistent with neoplasm.  This CT report also describes a large right chest wall mass which likely represents metastatic disease  although the possibility of primary chest wall tumor could not be excluded on a radiologic basis.The histologic findings are of a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm.  The positive keratin AE1/AE3 and cytokeratin 7 profile  combined with negative cytokeratin 20  S-100  melan-A  calretinin and cytokeratin 5/6 would support a poorly differentiated carcinoma and would exclude malignant melanoma and malignant mesothelioma. BerEP-4 is focally positive and CEA is positive  which would support interpretation of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The cytokeratin 7 positive/cytokeratin 20 negative profile with negative cytokeratin 5/6 and negative p63 would argue against a squamous carcinoma of pulmonary origin.  The cytokeratin 7 positive/cytokeratin 20 negative profile with negative villin and negative cdx-2 would argue against an adenocarcinoma of colorectal origin.  In a male patient  the cytokeratin 7 positive/cytokeratin 20 negative profile is the common expression seen in adenocarcinomas of lung and upper gastrointestinal primary origin.  Villin and cdx-2 are negative; however  this does not entirely exclude the possibility of a primary upper gastrointestinal tract adenocarcinoma on a histologic basis.  TTF-1 is negative; however  approximately 25-30% of lung adenocarcinomas can be negative with this marker. Based on the combination of the histologic findings  immunohistochemical expression and clinical findings of a 3.1 cm mass in the right upper lobe of the lung  the overall findings are most consistent with a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of pulmonary primary origin.CONSULTATION:  Yaping Wu  M.D.
LUNG  NEEDLE CORE BIOPSIES:1.  Invasive adenocarcinoma  moderately differentiated  involving fibrous tissue.COMMENT:  The above histologic feature could be consistent with metastasis from colon primary.  Immunohistochemical stains will be performed and reported later in an addendum.
POSTERIOR CHEST:  The submitted sections show on low power a biphasic epithelioid neoplasm.  The first component is of cohesive nests and glands of markedly atypical cells.  Some of these nested cells have a necrotic center.  The second component  which surround the first  is of single cells less atypical epithelioid and spindle.  The glandular component is highly suggestive of adenocarcinoma by routine morphology whereas the surrounding cells look more like mesothelial cells. Immunohistochemical stains show the atypical glandular component and some individual cells in solid clusters are positive for AE1/AE3  CK7  CEAm  CD15   EMA   Ber-EP4  villin  and focally for CDX-2  CK20 and mucin.  This support the epithelial nature of these cells.  WT-1 and  calretinin are positive in the second component  while both are negative in the glandular component which is in support to mesothelial nature of these cells. P53 is positive in the nested component while negative in the single cell component.  Proliferative cell marked Ki-67 is high in the nested component while low in the single cell component.   This immunoprofile is in support to the above observation.CD31  CD34  CK5/6 and TTF-1 are negative.The negative staining of TTF-1 rule out lung primary while the positive staining of Villin and CDX-2 is suggestive of gastrointestinal primary.   Clinical follow up is recommended.

Colonic tissue  without significant pathologic change.COMMENT:  The malignant neoplasm involving the colon is a poorly differentiated carcinoma  based on the positive staining for multiple keratin stains and absence of staining for markers associated with mesothelioma  such as cytokeratin 5/6 and calretinin.  The positive staining for BerEP-4 and focal positive staining for CEA in this colonic tumor would support interpretation as a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  The histologic appearance has neuroendocrine features  which is supported by immunohistochemical stains which show focal positive staining for CD56; stains for synaptophysin and chromogranin are negative.  The absence of staining for cytokeratin 20 is unusual for a typical colonic adenocarcinoma; however  poorly differentiated colonic carcinomas  including those with neuroendocrine features  can show loss of cytokeratin 20 expression.  However  it is unusual for a primary colonic carcinoma to show expression for cytokeratin 7  as seen here.  Also  the poorly differentiated carcinoma ulcerates the overlying colonic mucosa but direct origin from the existing colonic mucosa is not identified in the sections.  Based on this  additional immunohistochemical stains were performed in an attempt to evaluate any other possible primary sources for this poorly differentiated carcinoma.  Negative BRST-2 and estrogen receptor stains do not lend support for a breast primary; however  these stains can be negative in poorly differentiated breast carcinomas.  Per the surgeon  Dr. James Imatani  the patient does have a history of prior breast cancer but the specific type is unknown.  Unless this prior breast cancer was an unusual neuroendocrine type of carcinoma  it is unlikely that this represents a primary origin for this colonic carcinoma.  TTF-1 stain is negative  which does not lend support for a pulmonary primary origin.  Also  the surgeon states that no evidence of a lung lesion is present in this patient. The ovary and fallopian tube in the current case are negative for malignancy; the surgeon states that the opposite ovary and fallopian tube were noted to be grossly normal at the time of surgery. The surgeon states that the uterus was absent and that no gross abnormalities within the pelvic cavity were noted at the time of surgery. CD30 stain is negative  which would argue against an embryonal carcinoma.  Heppar stain is negative  which would argue against a hepatocellular carcinoma primary.  RCC stain is negative  which would argue against a renal cell carcinoma origin.  Villin and cdx-2 stains are negative  which does not lend support for an upper gastrointestinal primary source; however  in the setting of a cytokeratin 7 positive/cytokeratin 20 negative carcinoma  origin from an upper gastrointestinal primary source cannot be entirely excluded on a histologic basis.The omentum shows an adenocarcinoma with more glandular differentiation than that present in the colonic mass.  However  the immunohistochemical profile in the omental adenocarcinoma is similar to that seen in the colonic mass  including similar neuroendocrine features expressed on immunohistochemical stain for CD56.The lymph node metastases in the colonic region also show evidence of glandular differentiation and have a similar immunohistochemical profile to that seen in the colonic mass and the omentum  except for lack of neuroendocrine expression on immunohistochemical stains.The peritoneal implant is distorted but is also a poorly differentiated carcinoma.  This peritoneal implant also shows similar immunohistochemical features to that seen in the other sites  including evidence of neuroendocrine features with positive staining on CD56 stain.In summary  the malignant neoplasm in the colon is a poorly differentiated carcinoma with neuroendocrine features and immunohistochemical findings that would support a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma but without significant glandular differentiation.  The colonic lymph node metastases show adenocarcinoma with more evidence of glandular differentiation.  Similar glandular differentiation is present in the adenocarcinoma in the omental sections.  The peritoneal implant shows a similar histologic appearance to that in the colonic mass  although this biopsy is crushed in most areas of the tumor.  The immunohistochemical profile in all four tumor regions (omentum  colonic mass  lymph node metastases and peritoneal implant) is similar.  The main tumor mass is in the colonic resection specimen  although the immunophenotype is not typical of a primary colonic adenocarcinoma.  However  the colonic carcinoma is very poorly differentiated  which can result in aberrant immunohistochemical expression; based on the exclusion of other primary sources  as described above  the histology and presentation could still represent a colonic primary origin.  Given the cytokeratin 7 positive/cytokeratin 20 negative profile and the remaining results listed above  the main considerations for another possible primary site would include breast and upper gastrointestinal tract.  Correlation with the patient's previous breast cancer would be recommended; however  given the appearance of the colonic carcinoma  this would appear to be an unlikely primary source  unless this is an unusual type of breast carcinoma.  Origin from an upper gastrointestinal tract  primary source would need to be excluded on a clinical basis.CONSULTATION:  Xiaohong Cai  M.D.  Ph.D.  Gastrointestinal Pathologist

A)  LEFT SHOULDER BIOPSY AND B)  ADDITIONAL TISSUE:  Sections demonstrate multiple fragments of connective tissue and subcutaneous fat tissue diffusely infiltrated by nests or cords of poorly differentiated carcinoma with focal ductal and/or tubular formation.  No squamoid differentiation or neuroendocrine differentiation is identified.  No overlying upper dermis or epidermis is identified in the submitted tissue.  No normal adnexal structures or transition from residual adnexa to tumor is identified.  No atypical spindle cell proliferation or sarcomatous features are found.  By morphology  the differential diagnosis includes both metastatic carcinoma from other organ sites  and poorly differentiated skin adnexal carcinoma.IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY:  Sections (B1) were stained with a panel of antibodies utilizing appropriate positive and negative controls.Keratin (AE1/AE3):  positiveKeratin 7:  negativeKeratin 20:  negativeCEA-M:  positiveP63:  positiveCD15:  focally positiveER:  negativePSA:  negativeTTF-1:  negativeVillin: negativeCD56:  negativeRCC: negativesynaptophysin: negativeS-100:  negativeINTERPRETATION:  The above immunohistochemical studies confirm the morphologic impression of poorly differentiated carcinoma and essentially rules out the possibility of sarcoma  malignant melanoma and Merkel cell tumor.  The negativity of keratin 20 and Villin argues against metastatic carcinoma of GI tract including colonic origin.  The negativity of TTF-1 and keratin 7 makes the possibility of metastatic lung carcinoma and thyroid carcinoma unlikely.  The negativity of PSA rules out the possibility of metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma.  The negativity of synaptophysin and CD56 rules out the possibility of neuroendocrine carcinoma.The negativity of RCC does not support metastatic renal cell carcinoma.SPECIAL STAINS:  The special stain for mucicarmine shows focal positivity of tumor cells.
THORACENTESIS FLUID:1.  Adenocarcinoma.COMMENT: The chest CT of 2/8/2008 describes multiple lung nodules as well as surgical clips in the gastroesophageal junction region. Cytologic features of adenocarcinoma are present in these preparations. The immunohistochemical profile  specifically the presence of focal positivity in the malignant cells for BRST-2 and absence of staining in these cells for TTF-1  raises the possibility of a breast primary origin for the adenocarcinoma and clinical evaluation for the possibility of a breast lesion would therefore be recommended. Clinical correlation as to any prior upper GI malignancy would also be recommended  given the findings of adenocarcinoma with reported radiologic evidence of prior surgery in the gastroesophageal junction region.
ADRENAL GLAND  LEFT  NEEDLE CORE BIOPSY:1.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma (see microscopic description and comment).COMMENT:  The strong cytokeratin 7 staining and only focal weak staining with cytokeratin 20  combined with the absence of cdx-2 or villin staining  would argue against the possibility of a lower GI source from the colon.  Although TTF-1 stain is negative  approximately 25-30% of lung adenocarcinomas can be negative with this marker and a lung primary would need to be excluded on a clinical basis.  Likewise  the possibility of an upper gastrointestinal primary source  incuding pancreaticobiliary source  would need to be excluded on a clinical basis despite the negative cdx-2 and villin stains.
LYMPH NODE BIOPSY  LEFT INGUINAL:1.  Metastatic poorly differentiated pleomorphic carcinoma (see comment).COMMENT:  The morphologic findings are those of poorly differentiated pleomorphic metastatic carcinoma. As there is no any documented primary carcinoma  in her clinical history  a subsequent extensive immunohistochemical work-up is performed. The result shows the tumor cells to be positive for keratin 7 and p63  but negative for keratin 20 and for other organ-specific markers.  The differential diagnosis for a tumor with this immunohistochemical profile (CK7 positive/CK20 negative) includes wide spectrum of tumors  such as endometrial carcinoma  squamous carcinoma of uterine cervix  adenocarcinoma of lung  breast carcinoma  ovarian carcinoma  transitional cell carcinoma of urinary bladder and malignant mesothelioma.  The negativity of TTF-1 does not entirely support nor does it entirely rule out a pulmonary carcinoma. The negativity of ER and WT-1 does not entirely support nor does it completely rule out either breast carcinoma or ovarian serous carcinoma. The negativity of keratin 5/6 makes the possibility of a malignant mesothelioma unlikely.  The negativity of S100 essentially rules out the possibility of metastatic malignant melanoma.  The CK20 is negative  which makes the possibility of metastatic carcinoma of colorectal origin less likely.  Clinical and radiographic correlation is recommended for complete interpretation.This case was discussed with Dr. Morrow.  According to Dr. Morrow  the patient has a remote history of hysterectomy.  However  no any corresponding surgical pathology report is found in our data base or physician portal for pathologic correlation.CONSULTATION:  Sidney H. Rosenheim  M.D.

PRETRACHEAL LYMPH NODE R4  EXCISIONAL BIOPSY:1.  Fragmented anthracotic lymph node with metastatic adenocarcinoma  consistent with lung primary.  COMMENT:  This pattern is similar to that seen in the previous right lung core biopsy  SV08-1063. This case was reviewed at the Daily Intradepartmental QA Conference.
A)  PRETRACHEAL NODE  FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION:  There are six direct smears  one cytospin and one H&E from the cell block A1.  Some of the slides are positive for cytologically malignant cells consistent with an adenocarcinoma. The tumor has cohesive groups of atypical cells with goblet cell features.  There are eccentric plump slightly vacuolated pale cytoplasm and oval moderately enlarged nuclei with small nucleoli.  Rare cells have greater than two-fold nuclear variation in size. There are cells with nuclear overlapping and crowding.  The background has abundant blood  particularly in the air-dried smear.  The cells have loss of nuclear polarity and haphazard-arranged cells in nests.  There are decreased numbers of lymphocytes in the background  despite the anatomic site as being lymph node.  B)  SUBCARINAL LYMPH NODE  FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION:  There are five direct smears  one cytospin slide and one H&E slide from the cell block B1.  The cell block is hypocellular showing some sparse atypical cells consistent with an adenocarcinoma.  These have features similar to those of specimen A and are intermixed with abundant blood.  The cytospin slide is hypocellular showing predominantly blood and poorly  preserved and atypical cells.  Direct smears show greater cellularity with some atypical goblet cells exhibiting greater than two-fold nuclear variation in size and consistent with an adenocarcinoma.  These cohesive groups are similar to those seen in specimen A.  C)  BRONCHIAL WASHING:  There are two direct smears and one cytospin slide.  These show scattered ciliated respiratory columnar epithelial cells.   There are moderate numbers of macrophages  some of which are hemosiderin-laden  a few inflammatory cells and a few benign desquamated squamous cells.  Cytologically malignant cells are not identified.  JCH/mjvSince TTF-1 may be positive in both lung and thyroid primaries  two additional stains  calcitonin and galactin 3 are pending for final verification.  (ew)

This prior breast carcinoma was reported to be estrogen receptor positive.  A recent right lung needle core biopsy (SP07-23847) showed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma which was negative for estrogen receptor  negative for BRST-2  and positive for TTF-1.  This recent right lung needle core biopsy was diagnosed as a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with primary lung origin based on these findings.  The current resection specimen also shows a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma which is negative for BRST-2  negative for estrogen receptor  and positive for TTF-1.  The findings in the current lobectomy tumor are similar histologically and immunohistochemically to this prior right lung needle core biopsy and the lobectomy tumor is therefore also interpreted to represent a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of primary lung origin.
LUNG MASS:1.  Adenocarcinoma  moderately differentiated.  CONSULTATION:  James B. Durham  M.D.
RIGHT THORACENTESIS:  Two direct smears  a SurePath preparation  and sections of a cell block are examined.  These reveal scattered clusters of atypical cells consistent with adenocarcinoma.  These are often present in ball-like clusters and display enlarged  sometimes irregular nuclei with  occasionally  prominent nucleoli.  Sometimes  gland formation is seen.  These clusters of atypical cells exhibit similar cytological features to the tumor seen in the patient's previous lung biopsy from 2005 (SV05-4884)  which is reviewed concurrently with this case.

OMENTAL BIOPSY:    ******PRELIMINARY REPORT******1.  Papillary neoplasm  consistent with a papillary adenocarcinoma of uncertain primary  see comment.  COMMENT:  Given the prior history of a renal cell carcinoma  comparison with the prior histology would be helpful  especially if the prior renal cell carcinoma was a papillary type.  Other papillary neoplasms to consider include lung primary  pancreatic tumor and  less likely  thyroid.  A battery of immunoperoxidase stains is pending for further evaluation and a final diagnosis will be rendered  following intramural consultation and special stain results.
A) 9L LYMPH NODE:  Sections show a bisected anthracotic lymph node which is negative for malignancy on H&E and keratin immunohistochemical stains.B) 12L LYMPH NODE:  Sections show an anthracotic lymph node which is negative for malignancy on H&E and keratin immunohistochemical stains.C) LEFT LOWER LOBE:  Sections of the larger lesion show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma involving the lung parenchyma.  This carcinoma consists of irregular glandular structures lined by neoplastic cells having up to moderate nuclear pleomorphism.  The infiltrating glands are separated by a reactive fibrotic stromal response.  Invasive carcinoma does not invade the pleura.  The lung parenchyma at the periphery of the invasive carcinoma shows a prominent lepidic growth pattern with cells with similar cytologic features to those seen in the invasive component lining pre-existing alveolar spaces.The smaller lesion consists of a rather circumscribed proliferation of spindle cells with a cellular appearance throughout the lesion.  A thin fibrous capsule is present at the periphery of the lesion in areas.  A few small nests of similar-appearing cells are present in the tissue immediately adjacent to the main circumscribed mass.  A bronchus lined by respiratory epithelium with surrounding bronchial cartilage is present immediately adjacent to this spindle cell lesion.  The spindle cells have oval nuclei with finely dispersed chromatin.  No significant mitotic activity is identified.  No necrosis is present.  In an attempt to further define the origin of the cells in this spindle cell lesion  a panel of immunohistochemical stains is performed.  The spindle cells stain as follows:Keratin AE1/AE3:  negativeLow molecular weight keratin cam 5.2:  positiveSmooth muscle actin:  negativeHHF-35:  negativeSmooth muscle myosin heavy chain:  negativeDesmin:  negativeS-100:  negativeMelan-A:  negativemib-1:  negativeCD34:  negativeCD56:  positiveSynaptophysin:  negativeChromogranin:  positiveThe bronchial surgical margin and vascular margins are negative for malignancy.A single lymph node is present which is negative for malignancy on H&E and keratin immunohistochemical stains.D) 13L LYMPH NODE:  Sections show a single anthracotic lymph node which is negative for malignancy on H&E and keratin immunohistochemical stains.E) 7L LYMPH NODE:  Sections show fragments of anthracotic lymph node which are negative for malignancy on H&E and keratin immunohistochemical stains.F) 5L LYMPH NODE:  Sections show an anthracotic lymph node which is negative for malignancy on H&E and keratin immunohistochemical stains.

LUNG  RIGHT UPPER ANTERIOR  BIOPSY:1.  Scant amount of highly atypical epithelial cells present  consistent with non-small cell carcinoma (see microscopic description and comment). COMMENT:  The patient has a reported diagnosis of invasive poorly differentiated esophageal adenocarcinoma  diagnosed at an outside institution in April 2007.  Per the oncologist  the patient has subsequently received radiation therapy and chemotherapy  but the region in the lung mass was not included in the radiation field.  The current biopsy contains a scant amount of epithelial cells and these cells do show features which are interpreted to be cytologically malignant and consistent with a non-small cell carcinoma; however  further subclassification cannot be made with certainty based on the scant amount of malignant cells present and the lack of sufficient material to perform additional immunohistochemical studies.  Confirmation as to the specimen source (right upper anterior lung) is provided by the radiologist who performed the CT guided biopsy  Dr. Orhan Konez.CONSULTATION:  Dr. Xiaohong Cai  Dr. Sidney Rosenheim  and Dr. Yaping Wu.

Metastatic adenocarcinoma  morphologically and immunohistochemically consistent with lung primary.2.  No morphologic or immunohistochemical evidence of lymphoma.COMMENT:  The immunohistochemical studies show the neoplastic cells to be positive for keratin 7 and focally weakly positive for TTF-1  but negative for keratin 20 and Pax-5.  The immunohistochemical staining pattern confirms the initial morphologic impression of metastatic adenocarcinoma of lung primary.  The negativity for Pax-5 essentially excludes the involvement by B-cell lymphoma.

BRAIN TUMOR:  These sections reveal features of metastatic carcinoma.  The tumor cells are often nested and somewhat cohesive.  They are markedly pleomorphic with variable amounts of surrounding cytoplasm.  Mitoses are seen.  Some cells exhibit vacuoles containing bluish material  consistent with mucin.  Large zones of necrosis are also present.  The tumor exhibits similar morphologic features to the patient's primary lung adenocarcinoma  which is reviewed presently (SV05-10273).

BIOPSY SITE  RIGHT LUNG (PER CONTAINER LABEL):1.  Adenocarcinoma  well differentiated  consistent with pulmonary primary.Consultation: Sidney H. Rosenheim  M.D. and Jeffrey D. Harter  M.D.
LEFT LUNG BIOPSY:1.  Well-differentiated adenocarcinoma  consistent with lung primary (see comment).COMMENT:  A TTF-1 immunoperoxidase stain is pending for confirmation.CONSULTATION:  Yaping Wu  M.D.
A)  LEFT UPPER LOBE:  Review of frozen section slides and a slide prepared from the previously frozen tissue block (FSC A1) demonstrates the bronchial margin to be negative for neoplastic involvement.  Much of the lining epithelium has been lost.  FSCA2 contains fragments of anthracotic lymph node adjacent to blood vessels as well as atelectatic lung tissue.  Present in the anthracotic node are clusters of large atypical epithelial cells consistent with metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma.  This is confirmed with an immunohistochemical stain for keratin AE1.AE3.The hilar margin is included on A3  and included are fragments of bronchial cartilage and large vessels as well as portions of a lymph node that shows extensive anthracosis.  This particular node is negative for metastatic carcinoma.A4 through A6 demonstrate the entire neoplasm.  This is a typical pulmonary adenocarcinoma characterized by a sclerotic center and malignant glands that are composed of variably pleomorphic epithelial cells.  In some areas these have closely approximated  irregularly contoured nuclei with small nucleoli and medium coarse nuclear chromatin.  In other fields the tumor cells are considerably larger with inclusion-like nucleoli  coarse chromatin and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Neoplasm is noted retracting the pleural surface  but the neoplasm does not invade the pleura.  An adhesion to the parietal pleura is noted on slide A4  and additional invagination of the visceral pleura is noted on A5.  Vascular invasion is not demonstrated.A7 demonstrates random sections of lung at a distance from the neoplasm.  Adhesions to the parietal pleura are evident and there is significant alveolar exudation of pulmonary histiocytes.  Vascular congestion is noted  but there is no interstitial fibrosis or extensive emphysema.A8 demonstrates fragments of vessels and fibrous tissue but no definite lymph node is present.The en face stapled margin is included on slide A9  and this is found to be negative for neoplasm.B)  11L LYMPH NODE:  Two lymph nodes are recovered and these are stained with hematoxylin and eosin and with an immunohistochemical reagent for cytokeratin AE1/AE3.  The nodes show significant anthracosis  but no metastatic neoplasm is demonstrable.C)  LEVEL 12 LYMPH NODE:  One lymph node is recovered and this shows extensive anthracosis.  No neoplasm is present and a section stained with an anticytokeratin reagent is also found to be negative.D)  4R LYMPH NODE:  The histologic section includes fragments of three lymph nodes with anthracosis that are negative for metastatic neoplasm.  A section stained with keratin AE1/AE3 is also found to be negative for metastatic carcinoma.E)  2 AND 3R LYMPH NODES:  Thirteen fragments of lymph node are recovered and these are found to be negative for metastatic carcinoma when stained with hematoxylin and eosin and with an immunohistochemical reagent for cytokeratin AE1/AE3.F)  LEVEL 7 LYMPH NODE:  Fragments of six lymph nodes are recovered and these are found to be negative for metastatic carcinoma when stained with hematoxylin and eosin and with an immunohistochemical reagent for cytokeratin AE1/AE3.
LUNG CORES  BIOPSY:1.  Positive for adenocarcinoma (see comment).COMMENT:  Special stains are pending for further subclassification of the neoplasm present and will be added to this report as an addendum when available.
LUNG  RIGHT  NEEDLE CORE BIOPSY:1.  Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with non-mucinous bronchioalveolar features.
A)  RIGHT NECK MASS:  Sections demonstrate lymph node partially involved by reactive fibrous tissue.  This is composed of spindle-shaped fibroblasts in an edematous matrix.  Admixed with the proliferating fibroblasts are lymphocytes and scattered neutrophils.B)  ADDITIONAL RIGHT NECK MASS:  Sections prepared from the previously frozen and non-frozen tissue blocks demonstrate an extensively necrotic  poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma.  Where best preserved the neoplasm is found to be composed of malignant epithelial cells with irregular  ovoid  pleomorphic nuclei.  These are characterized by irregular  variably thick nuclear membranes  coarse chromatin and  in many instances  prominent nucleoli.  Abundant amphophilic cytoplasm is present.  The mitotic index is high and apoptotic cells are numerous  as are foci of necrosis.The neoplasm is evaluated with a limited panel of monoclonal antibodies.  The neoplasm shows weak positivity for cytokeratin AE1/AE3  but no significant staining with cytokeratin 5/6.  There is focal staining with P63.  A stain for S-100 protein  which is a marker of malignant melanoma  is negative.  The proliferation rate with mib-1 is intermediate  with 10-20% of the malignant nuclei staining positively.Additional immunostains on block B2 show focal strong positivity for cam 5.2 and strong staining with cytokeratin 7.  Cytokeratin 20  on the other hand  is negative.  A repeat P63 stain demonstrates focal strong nuclear staining.  This is by no means uniform.  A stain for synaptophysin  which is a neuroendocrine marker  is negative.The immunohistochemical panel is consistent with a metastatic lung carcinoma.  The patient underwent a right upper lobectomy and lymph node sampling for a poorly differentiated pulmonary adenocarcinoma in late November of 2007 (SP-07-23035).
A)  9R LYMPH NODES:  Included on slide A1 is dense fibrofatty soft tissue with some anthracotic pigment; particles of birefringent foreign material are seen in giant cells.  No neoplasm is present in the section.  Slide A2 contain an enlarged lymph node with large foci of dystrophic calcification.  No metastatic neoplasm is demonstrable in this enlarged lymph node that shows significant sinus histiocytosis with anthracosis.  An immunohistochemical stain for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 is negative.B)  12R LYMPH NODES:  Sections demonstrate a fragment of dense sclerotic fibrous tissue that shows extensive dystrophic calcification.  No metastatic carcinoma is identified in this tissue fragment and an immunohistochemical stain for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 is negative.C)  RIGHT LOWER LOBE BASILAR SEGMENT:  FSCC1 includes the surgical margin of clinical concern.  While no neoplasm is evident on review of the frozen section  there is abundant moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with a lepidic pattern evident on the frozen section control slide.  C2 through C5 include the remaining surgical margin.  Present on C5 is an additional focus of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma which is present immediately adjacent to a dilated bronchus.C6 through C8 demonstrate the neoplasm and its relationship to the overlying pleura.  As previously described  this is a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  Sections of the mass show a central fibrotic area and an infiltrating moderately differentiated neoplasm.  The malignant epithelial cells are variable in size and outline with irregular nuclear membranes  coarse linear nuclear chromatin and prominent centrally located nucleoli.  Abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm is present.  The neoplasm shows a strong lepidic growth pattern extending tongues of neoplasm into the adjacent aerated parenchyma.  Neoplasm is present immediately beneath the overlying visceral pleura.  Vascular invasion is not identified.C9 and C10 demonstrate lung tissue at a distance from the main nodule.  A subpleural zone of bronchiolar metaplasia is noted on C9.  These cells are not malignant  however.  There is a mild degree of pulmonary emphysema.  D)  LEVEL 7 LYMPH NODES:  Fragments of approximately five lymph nodes are recovered and these are all found to be negative for metastatic adenocarcinoma when stained with hematoxylin and eosin and with an immunohistochemical reagent for cytokeratin AE1/AE3.  There is extensive anthracofibrosis identified.  A hyalinized sclerotic focus is also present.E)  RIGHT 2  3R LYMPH NODES:  Sections demonstrate fragments of eight lymph nodes that show extensive anthracofibrosis.  These are negative for metastatic carcinoma when stained with hematoxylin and eosin and with an immunohistochemical reagent for cytokeratin AE1/AE3.  F)  4R LYMPH NODES:  Fragments of eight lymph nodes show anthracofibrosis  but no evidence of metastatic tumor when stained with hematoxylin and eosin and with an immunohistochemical reagent for cytokeratin AE1/AE3.

BONE  ILIAC CREST  NEEDLE CORE BIOPSY (SEE COMMENT):1.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma (see microscopic description and comment).COMMENT:  The specimen is not designated as to site.  However  an operative report on Physician Portal describes a CT-guided biopsy of an iliac crest lesion.  This operative report describes multiple bony metastatic sites.  The H&E histologic features are those of metastatic adenocarcinoma.  In the setting of a cytokeratin 7 positive  cytokeratin 20 negative  villin positive immunohistochemical profile  origin from an upper gastrointestinal source  including pancreatic and biliary tract regions  would be in the differential diagnosis.  Origin from a lung adenocarcinoma would also be in the differential diagnosis  as a portion of lung adenocarcinomas can be villin positive and approximately 30% of lung adenocarcinomas can be TTF-1 negative.  The cytokeratin 7 positive  cytokeratin 20 negative  cdx-2 negative profile would rule out a lower gastrointestinal primary source.  The negative Heppar stain would argue against a hepatocellular carcinoma source.  The cytokeratin 7 positive  cytokeratin 20 negative  PSA negative and PSAP negative profile would rule out prostatic adenocarcinoma.  The neoplasm does show focal staining for synaptophysin but is negative for chromogranin and this is interpreted to represent focal neuroendocrine features in the adenocarcinoma.CONSULTATION:  Sidney H. Rosenheim  M.D.

Lymphatic involvement by carcinoma identified.  CONSULTATION: Franklin D. Curl  M.D.COMMENT:  The patient has a history of infiltrating ductal carcinoma involving the right breast (SP-06-17741).  A prior right lower lobe lung biopsy was diagnosed in 2006 as containing metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with metastatic ductal carcinoma of the breast (SP-06-16215); this neoplasm was reported to be positive for estrogen receptor and BRST-2 and negative for TTF-1.  The current lung biopsy shows a non-small cell carcinoma which is negative for estrogen receptor  negative for BRST-2 and positive for TTF-1.  The histologic appearance and immunohistochemical profile in this current lung biopsy would fit with a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of primary lung origin.

COMMENT:  The Part A frozen section slides at the time of surgery were interpreted to contain a neoplasm consistent with adenocarcinoma.  Permanent sections of the frozen tissue remnant  as well as permanent sections of the remainder of the grossly suspicious region  show fibrosis  patchy mild chronic inflammation and focal anthracotic pigment deposition but are negative for malignancy.  Multiple additional deeper levels from all tissue blocks from the grossly suspicious region as well as multiple additional blocks of tissue from all grossly fibrotic regions show similar findings and are also negative for malignancy. The frozen section slides are reviewed and are interpreted to show findings similar to those described in the permanent sections of the frozen tissue remnant; the frozen section slides are assessed on final interpretation to be negative for malignancy. The findings are discussed by telephone with the surgeon  Dr. John Handy  on December 12  2007. CONSULTATION (PART A):  P. Holbrook Howard  M.D.

Five of nine N1 lymph nodes are involved by metastatic carcinoma (three level 12 and one level 13 lymph nodes in Part A are replaced by metastatic carcinoma with extranodal tumor extension as well as fragments of a level 11R lymph node in Part C which shows focal metastatic carcinoma). In addition  the Part E superior mediastinal biopsy specimen shows tissue fragments which are involved by poorly differentiated carcinoma with extensive necrosis. Definite lymph node architecture is not identified in these Part E sections; however  given the findings above  this is interpreted to represent additional metastatic carcinoma replacing mediastinal lymph nodes. The findings are discussed by telephone with the surgeon  Dr. John Handy  who states that the superior mediastinal biopsies were taken from the ipsilateral side. The tumor is therefore classified as a T1  N2  MX stage.Pathology Staging Summary*Specimen type:  Lobectomy*Laterality:  Right*Tumor site (upper  middle  lower):  Upper*Tumor size:  3 cm*Histologic type:  Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma*Invasion of:Pleura: *Invasion of visceral pleura:  No *Tumor on visceral pleural surface:  NoMainstem Bronchus: Not applicable:  Yes*Chest Wall:  Not applicable*Diaphragm:  Not applicable*Other:  Not applicable*Total lymph nodes:  9 N1 lymph nodes and separate superior mediastinal biopsy      *Number positive (indicate if N1  N2  or N3):  5 N1 lymph nodes and separate mediastinal biopsy (see comment above) *Grade:  Poorly differentiatedVessel Invasion:  *Large vessel invasion (venous):  Not identified *Large vessel invasion *(arterial):  Not identified Lymphatic invasion:  YesMargins: *Bronchial margin:  Uninvolved by carcinoma *Vascular margin:  Uninvolved by carcinoma *Parenchymal margin (if applicable):  Not applicable *Parietal pleura/chest wall margin (if applicable):  Not applicable*AJCC Pathology Stage:  T1  N2  MX

Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (see comment).C)  POSTERIOR FOSSA MASS AA ORIGIN:1.  Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (see comment).D)  LEFT PARIETAL DURA:1.  Fragments of dense fibrous tissue consistent with dura  benign.COMMENT:  Immunohistochemically  the tumor cells are positive for CK7 and P16. They are weakly positive for villin. They are negative for TTF-1  CDX2 and CK20. The negativity of TTF-1 and CDX2 makes metastatic lung and colorectal carcinoma unlikely. The positivity of CK7 and p16 suggests metastatic adenocarcinoma from female reproductive system. Therefore  if the patient's previous cervical cancer is an adenocarcinoma  this tumor could be compatible with a possible metastatic cervical adenocarcinoma. However  metastatic ovarian cancer should be considered too. Clinical correlation is recommended. Unfortunately  her previous cervical specimen is not available for comparison.
A) LEFT UPPER LOBE:  Review of frozen section slides and slides prepared from the previously frozen tissue block demonstrate a bronchial margin that is uninvolved by neoplasm.  A2 and A3 contain the vascular and bronchial margins as described in the section code.  Both sections are negative for neoplasm. A4 through A7 demonstrate the neoplasm in relationship to the overlying pleura.  The sections demonstrate a pulmonary adenocarcinoma that extends immediately beneath the visceral pleura which is deeply invaginated.  The neoplasm is composed of malignant epithelial cells with irregular ovoid hyperchromatic nuclei.  These have coarse chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli.  Nuclear cytoplasmic inclusions are noted in many cells and there is abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Peripherally the neoplasm exhibits a lepidic growth pattern but centrally it is quite sclerotic.  Vascular invasion is not identified although tumor compresses a major pulmonary vessel.Slides A8 and A9 demonstrate lung tissue uninvolved by neoplasm.  This shows a mild degree of pulmonary emphysema.  Several dilated bronchi are present and these are lined by normal respiratory epithelium.  There is no active inflammation of the pulmonary tissue.A13 demonstrates four level 12 lymph nodes.  These show foci of anthracofibrosis but they are negative for metastatic adenocarcinoma.B) LEVEL 3 LYMPH NODES:  Three fragments of fat replaced lymph node are found to negative for metastatic carcinoma.C) LEVEL 7 LYMPH NODE:  Sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin and with an immunohistochemical reagent for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 demonstrate fragments of three lymph nodes.  These demonstrate anthracofibrosis but they are negative for metastatic carcinoma.D) 4R LYMPH NODES:  A solitary large hemisected lymph node is present.  This is stained with hematoxylin and eosin and with an immunohistochemical reagent for cytokeratin AE1/AE3.  The lymph node is negative for metastatic carcinoma.E) LEVEL 9 LYMPH NODES:  Sections demonstrate a lymph node with anthracofibrosis.  This is negative for metastatic carcinoma when stained with hematoxylin and eosin and with an immunohistochemical reagent for cytokeratin AE1/AE3.F) LEVEL 5 LYMPH NODE:  Sections demonstrate two lymph nodes that exhibit anthracofibrosis but are negative for metastatic carcinoma.  The sections have been stained with hematoxylin and eosin and with an immunohistochemical reagent for cytokeratin AE1/AE3.

This is a poorly differentiated large cell undifferentiated carcinoma characterized by nodules of neoplastic epithelial cells that are present in a densely sclerotic and inflamed stroma.  The tumor cell nuclei are irregularly polygonal with finely stippled nuclear chromatin but marked hyperchromasia.  These cells have high N:C ratios  small nucleoli and a scant amount of lightly stained eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitotic figures are readily identified.  Neoplasm is present within a millimeter of the green inked visceral pleural surface. The stapled margin of resection is included on A3 and A4.  Both of these sections are found to be negative for neoplasm.  There is subpleural interstitial fibrosis with cyst formation.  Additional sections of lung tissue included on slide A5 show subpleural emphysema but no evidence of neoplasm or active inflammation.The neoplasm is evaluated with a panel monoclonal antibodies.  The tumor is found to be negative for synaptophysin and chromogranin and it is also negative for TTF-1  which is a marker of many pulmonary adenocarcinomas.  The alveolar lining cells stain positively with this reagent and serve as an internal positive control.The neoplasm is strongly positive for cytokeratin 7  while it is negative for cytokeratin 20 and CD56.  The neoplasm is also negative for Ber-Ep4 an adenocarcinoma marker  mucicarmine  and p63 as squamous carcinoma marker.  There is focal weak positivity with keratin 5/6  which is a marker of squamous differentiation.  The proliferation rate with mib-1 is high.B)  LEFT LOBE NODULE:  Review of frozen section slides and a slide prepared from the previously frozen tissue block demonstrates a subpleural fibrous scar characterized by foci of fibroblastic proliferation with a myxoid stroma.  The adjacent tissue demonstrates extensive subpleural emphysema with marked interstitial fibrosis and cyst formation.  No neoplasm is demonstrated.  The surgically stapled margin included on B2 is negative for neoplasm and again shows the extensive interstitial fibrosis with honeycombing in the subpleural region.  The remaining tissue on B3 again shows extensive subpleural disease with pleural fibrosis  interstitial fibrosis and honeycomb change.  No neoplasm is demonstrable.C)  LEFT AP WINDOW NODE:  Nine fragments of hemorrhagic tissue are included on the slide.  These are all fragments of lymph node that show a varying degree of anthracofibrosis.  The nodal fragments are all found to be negative for metastatic carcinoma.  An immunohistochemical stain for keratin AE1/AE3 is negative.D)  LEVEL 2 NODE:  Sections demonstrate a lymph node heavily involved by anthracofibrosis.  This is negative for neoplasm.  A section stained with the anti-keratin reagent AE1/AE3 is negative for metastatic carcinoma.E)  SEGMENTAL RESECTION  LEFT LOWER LOBE:  Slide A1 demonstrates the surgical margin of resection which includes the bronchus which is negative for neoplastic involvement.  The included vessels are also found to be negative.  E2 through E6 demonstrate the stapled surgical margin.  Additional fragments of bronchus and visceral pleura are present and emphysematous changes particularly in the subpleural zone are noted.  No residual neoplasm is identified in the multiple sections examined.  Foci of atelectasis are noted.  A focal perivascular and peribronchial lymphocytic infiltrate is noted.Multiple additional sections of lung again demonstrate subpleural emphysema  normally differentiated bronchial epithelium and a multifocal perivascular and peribronchial lymphocytic infiltrate.

THORACENTESIS FLUID:1.  Positive for malignant cells; cytologic and immunohistochemical features of adenocarcinoma (see microscopic description and comment).COMMENT:  Occasional cell clusters are present in the preparations which have cytologically malignant features as  described.  The three-dimensional clustering of these cells and prominent nucleoli are cytologic features consistent with adenocarcinoma.  Staining of a few of these cells with BerEP-4 and lack of staining of these cells for WT-1  calretinin and cytokeratin 5/6 are findings supportive of adenocarcinoma and would argue against mesothelial origin. Further immunohistochemical classification as to the primary source of this adenocarcinoma cannot be made with certainty given the rarity of malignant cells in the cell block.  The patient's history of ovarian serous carcinoma is noted.  Ovarian serous carcinomas are often positive for WT-1; however  the lack of staining for WT-1 in the occasional cells present in this thoracentesis fluid cell block does not exclude this possibility as a primary origin.  TTF-1 is negative; however  adenocarcinomas of lung primary can be negative in approximately 25% of cases and the absence of TTF-1 staining in these occasional cells in the cell block does not exclude the possibility of a lung primary origin.  Clinical correlation would be required for further determination of the primary source for this process.CONSULTATION:  Franklin D. Curl  M.D.

Durham  M.D.  Dermatopathologist
LUNG CORE BIOPSY:1.  Positive for moderately well-differentiated adenocarcinoma.
OUTSIDE SLIDES REPRESENTING BIOPSY  LEFT UPPER LOBE MASS  LUNG:  Sections from the core biopsy specimen demonstrate four cores of markedly inflamed pulmonary tissue with prominent fibrous scar formation.  Some residual alveolar spaces are present which are lined by atypical type 2 pneumocytes.  These cells are detached from the underlying alveolar septa  making evaluation difficult.  Definitive evidence of linear growth  stratification and tufting to be definitive for adenocarcinoma are not present.  Accompanying touch prep slides demonstrate occasional clusters of cytologically atypical cells which are more worrisome than the features present on the core biopsy.
A)  WANG NEEDLE BIOPSY:  There is no cell block.  There are nine direct smears and one cytospin slide.  In this  there are some atypical cells  positive for cytologically malignant change  particularly in slide A5 which has abundant metachromatic material  probably mucin  intermixed with these cohesive groups of atypical cells.  These atypical cells are large  exhibiting loss of nuclear polarity  hyperchromatic enlarged nuclei  nuclear overlapping and crowding  hyperchromatic chromatin and small nucleoli.  There is abundant blood in the background.  B)  BRONCHIAL BRUSHING:  There is one H&E slide from cell block B1 and one cytospin slide.  The cell block shows very scant material  mostly strips of reactive respiratory columnar epithelial cells intermixed with leukocytes  hemolyzed blood and macrophages.  There are some rare atypical large cells and a fleck of probable lung parenchyma elsewhere  but this disappears in the deeper levels.  The cytospin slide shows a single cohesive cluster of atypical large cells consistent with adenocarcinoma.  The high N:C ratios  multiple small nucleoli and scant ill-defined cytoplasm are atypical.  Also  there is nuclear crowding  overlapping and some smudged chromatin.  The background has some scattered respiratory columnar epithelia.  C)  BRONCHIAL WASHING:  There is no cell block.  There are two direct smears and one cytospin slide  exhibiting some scattered cohesive clusters of atypical cells similar to that already described in specimen A and consistent with an adenocarcinoma.  The background has some scattered squamous cells  macrophages  respiratory columnar epithelial cells and leukocytes.  JCH:mgh

Tumor present at inked surgical margin.COMMENT:  The morphologic features of this tumor are those of an adenocarcinoma.  The immunophenotypic profile is not clearly indicative of a specific primary site; however  lung primary remains in the differential  despite failure of the tumor cells to react with TTF-1 - the morphologic and other immunostaining pattern could be compatible with lung primary.  Other possibilities  however  cannot be unequivocally excluded.  The findings were discussed with Dr. Fred Ey on 9/20/07.

A)  RIGHT UPPER LOBE:  Sections demonstrate nests and cords of polygonal neoplastic cells infiltrating the lung parenchyma with associated stromal reaction and fibrosis.  The neoplastic cells are intermediate in size showing oval to irregular nuclear contours  fine nuclear chromatin  inconspicuous nucleoli  and moderate eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Mitoses including occasional atypical mitoses are easily found  accounting for up to five mitoses per high power field.  However  no nuclear molding or tumor necrosis is identified. No squamous or glandular differentiation of tumor is identified.   Multiple small tumor nests are scattered in the adjacent lung parenchyma.  In addition  multiple tumor foci are noted in the angiolymphatic spaces.  The peripheral margin is free of tumor  but foci of metastatic tumor are noted close to the pleural surface within approximately 2 mm from the inked surface.  Two lymph nodes (level 12 and13) are negative for metastatic tumor.  The bronchial margins are free of tumor.  B)  2R AND 3R LYMPH NODES:  Sections demonstrate six anthracotic lymph nodes without evidence of metastatic tumor.C)  4R LYMPH NODE:  Secftions demonstrate two anthracotic lymph nodes without evidence of metastatic tumor.D)  LEVEL 7 LYMPH NODE:  Sections demonstrate three anthracotic lymph nodes without evidence of metastatic tumor.IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY:  Sections (A4) were stained with a panel of antibodies utilizing appropriate positive and negative controls.  The cells of interest exhibit the following phenotype:Pankeratin -- weakly positive;keratin 7 --negative;keratin 20 -- negative;TTF-1 -- positive;CD56 -- positive;Synaptophysin -- positive;Chromogranin -- positive;Estrogen receptor -- negative;Progesterone receptor -- negative;BRST-2 -- negative.Immunohistochemical studies are performed to characterize the nature of the neoplasm and to rule out the possibility of metastatic breast carcinoma.  The stains show the neoplastic cells to be positive for neuroendocrine markers and weakly positive for pan keratin  confirming the morphologic impression of neuroendocrine tumor.  The positivity of TTF-1 supports a primary lung tumor.  The negativity of ER  PR and BRST-2 rules out the possibility of metastatic breast carcinoma.SPECIAL STAINS:  Mucin stain shows absence of mucin differentiation of tumor cells  ruling out the possibility of adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation.
20G  LUNG  LEFT LOWER LOBE:  These are cores of lung tissue infiltrated by a malignant neoplasm with features of an adenocarcinoma.  The tumor often forms gland-like structures.  Focal necrosis is seen.  The cells display moderate nuclear pleomorphism and several nucleoli exhibit intranuclear inclusions.  The surrounding stroma appears desmoplastic.  A panel of immunostains will be performed and the results and final diagnosis reported in an addendum.
A)  TERMINAL ILEUM AND RIGHT COLON  SEGMENTAL RESECTION:1.   Poorly differentiated carcinoma [see microscopic description and comment].2.  Carcinoma involves colonic mucosa (including areas of ulceration)  submucosa  muscularis propria and pericolonic soft tissue with involvement of inked pericolonic soft tissue surface.3.  Proximal and distal surgical margins  negative for dysplasia or malignancy.4.  Twelve regional colonic lymph nodes  negative for malignancy (0/12).5.  Appendix with fibrous obliteration of lumen and fibrovascular serosal adhesions  negative for dysplasia or malignancy.6.  Separate colonic segment with fibrovascular serosal adhesions  negative for dysplasia or malignancy.B)  ABDOMINAL SIDEWALL:1.  Poorly differentiated carcinoma [see microscopic description and comment].C)  GALLBLADDER  CHOLECYSTECTOMY:1.  Fibrovascular serosal adhesions and associated mild chronic inflammation of serosa  negative for malignancy.COMMENT:  The tumor in the right colon and the abdominal sidewall has a similar appearance and on H&E sections is a malignant neoplasm without significant evidence of differentiation  being composed of solid sheets of high-grade neoplastic cells.  Initial immunohistochemical stains show the malignancy to be positive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and negative for multiple markers associated with malignant melanoma (S-100  HMB-45 and melan-A)  as well as negative for the lymphoid marker CD45.  The malignancy is negative for cytokeratin 7; however  it is also negative for cytokeratin 20  which is typically positive in colonic adenocarcinomas.  Also  the malignancy is negative for cdx-2 and villin  which are often positive with carcinomas of gastrointestinal tract origin  including colon.  The malignancy is negative for chromogranin and synaptophysin  which are markers associated with neuroendocrine differentiation.  CD30 is negative  which would argue against embryonal carcinoma as well as anaplastic large cell lymphoma.  PSA and PSAP are negative  arguing against a prostatic origin.  Heppar is negative  arguing against a hepatocellular carcinoma origin.  CD10 and RCC are negative  arguing against a renal cell origin.  CD5/6 and p63 are negative  arguing against a squamous lung origin and TTF-1 is negative  arguing against a pulmonary adenocarcinoma origin.  CD117 is negative  arguing against gastrointestinal stromal tumor.  Vimentin is positive and actin is positive; however  HHF-35 and desmin are negative  arguing against a smooth muscle origin.  Myogenin is negative  arguing against a skeletal muscle origin.  Calretinin is strongly positive in the tumor cells; however  cytokeratin 5/6 and WT-1 were negative and the clinical history obtained from the surgeon does not include evidence of a diffuse peritoneal involvement  which would argue against a mesothelial origin.  BerEP-4 is positive  which also lends support to evidence of epithelial origin for the malignancy.  CEA  EMA and cytokeratin 903  additional epithelial markers  are negative.  CD20  an additional lymphoid marker  is negative.The clinical setting is discussed with the surgeon  Dr. Ahmad.  Dr. Ahmad states that a colonic mass was present which extended to involve the abdominal sidewall.  Clinically  evidence for a diffuse peritoneal process was not present at the time of surgery.  Additional imaging work-up  including PET scanning  has not shown any additional lesions suspicious for an additional primary source and no prior primary malignancy is known for this patient  according to the surgeon.Based on positive AE1/AE3  cam 5.2 and BerEP-4 staining in this poorly differentiated malignancy  the tumor is classified as a poorly differentiated carcinoma.  Although calretinin is positive in the tumor cells  other mesothelial markers such as cytokeratin 5/6 and WT-1 are negative and the clinical impression obtained from the surgeon does not fit with the expected clinical findings of a malignant mesothelioma.  The immunohistochemical stains obtained in an attempt to subclassify the carcinoma are unusual.  The neoplasm does not show the typical immunophenotype of a colonic adenocarcinoma  being negative for cytokeratin 20 as well as cdx-2 and villin.  However  numerous immunohistochemical stains were obtained which ruled out carcinomas from typical primary sites having a cytokeratin 7/cytokeratin 20 negative profile  such as prostate  liver and kidney.  Embryonal carcinoma of germ cell origin was ruled out also.  Immunohistochemical stains do not support a gastrointestinal stromal tumor.  The immunohistochemical pattern does not fit with squamous carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of pulmonary origin.  Neuroendocrine features are not identified on immunohistochemical stains.  In summary  the malignancy in the colon is a poorly differentiated carcinoma. In the absence of definitive evidence for a primary origin outside of the colon on clinical findings  imaging studies or on the basis of immunohistochemical stains  the poorly differentiated carcinoma is favored to be of colonic origin  albeit with an immunophenotype which is unusual for a primary colonic adenocarcinoma.  Because of the unusual H&E appearance and immunohistochemical profile  the case will also be submitted to Dr. David Klimstra at Memorial Sloan-Kettering for outside consultation.  Results of his findings will follow in an addendum report.

A)  RIGHT LOWER LOBE:  Sections of the grossly described 10 cm tumor demonstrate a pulmonary adenocarcinoma with somewhat heterogeneous histologic morphology.  The tumor is comprised primarily of moderately differentiated invasive glandular elements producing fairly abundant mucin.  In some areas  particularly towards the periphery  free-floating balls of tumor are present within pools of mucin and a slight papillary morphology is present.  The tumor invades the overlying pleura.  Tumor is not seen directly within lymphatic spaces  although two of four level 11 lymph nodes are positive for metastatic tumor.  No extracapsular extension is seen.  No definitive large vessel invasion is observed.  Resection margins are free of tumor.  The non-neoplastic lung shows mild emphysema.B)  9R LYMPH NODE:  Sections demonstrate a single bisected lymph node.

LEFT LUNG MASS:1.  Mucinous adenocarcinoma  see comment.COMMENT:  The immunohistochemical stains suggest a lower gastrointestinal primary (see also microscopic description).  Occasional primary pulmonary carcinomas may express gastrointestinal markers  although such tumors typically co-express cytokeratin 7 and TTF-1 as well.  Only a small number of tumor cells are present on the immunohistochemical-stained sections  which raises the possibility of sampling variability in the stains in regard to the keratin 7 and TTF-1 if the tumor is clinically thought to be a pulmonary primary; however  a colonic primary should be excluded clinically.

OUTSIDE SLIDES (9)  REPRESENTING MEDIASTINUM  BIOPSIES:1.  High grade  poorly differentiated carcinoma of unknown primary  see comment.COMMENT:  I have discussed this case with Dr. Kurup this morning at approximately 10:45 AM.  She communicated to me that the patient had a history of breast carcinoma (ductal /lobular) which was ER and PR positive in 2005  stage 1.  She now presents with extensive mediastinal  hilar  supraclavicular  and cervical lymphadenopathy  which clinically is more appropriate for a lung primary.  As I have discussed with Dr. Kurup  the fact that this is a high grade neoplasm  which is ER and PR negative  does not confirm that this is a breast primary  however  the positive cytokeratin 7 and negative cytokeratin 20 are certainly consistent with a breast primary if the prior ER and PR on the primary were negative.  Given this history  I think that other etiologies should receive consideration  including lung carcinoma (despite the negative TTF-1 immunoperoxidase stain).  High grade poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma may be negative with the TTF-1.  Other tumors under consideration which present with positive cytokeratin 7 and negative cytokeratin 20 include ovarian serous carcinoma  endometrial adenocarcinoma  epithelial mesothelioma  thymoma  bile duct carcinoma  in addition to a breast or lung primary.  Histologically  the tumor on H&E stain does not have the typical histology of an ovarian serous or endometrial carcinoma primary.We have a couple of additional markers for breast primaries  which include BRST2  BRST1 and mammoglobin should there be a desire to perform a larger battery of stains.  Under these circumstances  we would need the paraffin block  which is preferred over unstained slides  and these should be sent to my attention.
A) LEFT PLEURAL BIOPSY:  These sections reveal lung and pleura adhesed together and extensively involved by adenocarcinoma.  The tumor involves the lung as well as the pleura.  The tumor is characterized by nests of cells which are quite variable in size and shape.  There are areas of tubules/gland formation.  The cells display moderately pleomorphism and variable amounts of cytoplasm.  Mitotic figures are readily identified and abnormal forms are frequently encountered.B) PERICARDIAL WINDOW:  These sections reveal fibrous tissue with interspersed islands of fat.  There is extensive involvement by adenocarcinoma similar to that described above.  Additionally  in these sections there are occasional  somewhat larger nests of cells with central areas of necrosis.  The morphologic features are reminiscent of breast carcinoma and a battery of immunostains will be performed on block B2. C) PERICARDIUM:  These sections also reveal fibrous tissue with interspersed islands of fat  vessels  and nerves.  There is again extensive involvement by adenocarcinoma similar to that described above.

RIGHT LUNG:  The specimen consists of a single core fragment of lung tissue that has been replaced by scar tissue.  At one end of the core fragments there are several trapped glands lined by atypical cuboidal epithelium.  These may represent reactive atypia  but a low-grade adenocarcinoma cannot be excluded.  The case will be sent in consultation to Dr. Mary Beth Beasley  expert in pulmonary pathology  and a final report will be issued.
LEFT LUNG:  The specimen consists of multiple core fragments of pulmonary alveolar parenchyma that have focal interstitial fibrosis with hemosiderophages.  There are also hemosiderophages in some of the alveolar spaces.  The pneumocytes are unremarkable.  There are also two tiny fragments of mucinous columnar epithelium with basally located nuclei arranged in papillary fronds. This may represent a low-grade adenocarcinoma or a bronchoalveolar carcinoma.  This case will be forwarded in consultation to Dr. Mary Beth Beasley  expert in pulmonary pathology  and a final report will be issued.

Proximal  distal and radial surgical margins are negative for neoplasm.3.  Three out of fifteen lymph nodes  positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma  confined to the lymph node  one of which has only isolated tumor cells  identified on H&E and cytokeratin stains (3/15).COMMENT: In the absence of Dr. Gilster  I spoke to his nurse  Jill  today at 12:45p.m. to communicate my concern about the immunophenotype of the tumor  in this case  which is unusual for a GI primary  especially with respect to the keratin 7/20 and TTF-1. Most tumors  which are positive with TTF-1  represent neoplasms of lung or thyroid origin  and only a very small minority  approximately 2% of colorectal neoplasms are positive for TTF-1   per Immunoquery.Given the battery of immunostain results  it is imperative to exclude another primary source in this patient  clinically. I shall discuss this case with Dr. X. Cai  our GI pathologist  upon his return  for another opinion.

A)  RIGHT LOWER LOBE LUNG BIOPSY:  1.  Fragments of bronchial wall with marked chronic inflammation.2.  No granulomas or malignancy are seen.B)  LEFT MAIN PROXIMAL LUNG BIOPSY:  1.  Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma  see comment.C)  LEFT MAIN DISTAL LUNG BIOPSY:  1.  Fragments of bronchial wall with marked inflammation and focal ulceration.2.  No granulomas or malignancy are seen.COMMENT: Immunohistochemical studies demonstrate that the tumor is positive for cytokeratin 20 and negative for cytokeratin 7  TTF-1  prostate specific antigen and cdx-2.  Positive staining for cytokeratin 20 in the absence of staining for cytokeratin 7 would be highly unusual in a pulmonary primary and other primary sources  such as the GI tract  might be considered.  Unfortunately  other more specific markers are negative and do not support a more specific site of origin.   Findings were discussed with Dr. Skokan on May 3 and May 4  2007.

LLL (LUNG):1.  Well-differentiated adenocarcinoma  favor pulmonary primary  pending the results of immunoperoxidase stains for confirmation of cell origin.COMMENT:  The histology is consistent with a lung primary.  However  TTF-1 and cytokeratin 7/20 stains are pending for further documentation  since no clinical history was provided. According to portal information  there is a history of                                                                                                    breast carcinoma                                                                                                    of unknown type. Thus  estrogen receptor and BRST-2 immunostains are pending  also. Consultation: Jeffrey Harter  M.D.
LUNG MASS:  A poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma is found in multiple fragments of fibrous tissue.  The cells are arranged in nests  cords and strands.  They have pleomorphic hyperchromatic nuclei that show poikilonucleosis and anisonucleosis.  They often have conspicuous nucleoli.  Occasional atypical mitoses are found in this population of cells which also includes a granular  sometimes small vacuolated cytoplasm suggesting adenocarcinoma differentiation.
TWO CORE SAMPLES OF RIGHT LUNG MASS:1.  Adenocarcinoma.Comment:  This case was reviewed at the Daily Intradepartmental QA Conference.
OUTSIDE SLIDES (10) REPRESENTING 1 - PANCREAS AND DUODENUM  WHIPPLE'S RESECTION:1.  Pancreatic mucinous cystic neoplasm.COMMENT:  Given the overall morphology  the tumor appears most compatible with a mucinous tumor of low metastatic potential  as was originally diagnosed.The mucinous adenocarcinoma present in the patient's recent right middle lobe lung resection (SP-07-5221) is morphologically different from the pancreatic tumor and is additionally strongly positive for TTF-1  supporting a primary pulmonary origin.  Therefore  the pancreatic neoplasm would appear to be unrelated to the pulmonary carcinoma.
LUNG:1.  Adenocarcinoma.2.  Immunohistochemical stains are pending; an addendum report will follow.COMMENT:  Preliminary findings were discussed with Dr. Keppel on April 3rd  2007.
MID ESOPHAGUS AT 33 CM  FNA:  The cell block sections contain numerous atypical large  rounded or polygonal cells predominantly distributed as discohesive single cells having variable amounts of amphophilic  non-keratinized cytoplasm  with an additional minority of cells having irregularly vacuolated cytoplasm.  The cells show considerable variation in size and have relatively large  irregularly rounded vesicular nuclei with prominent chromocenters and nucleoli.  There are small numbers of atypical mitoses.  No papillary or tubuloglandular arrangements of cells are noted.  The atypical cells show positive immunostaining for cytokeratins 5/6  calretinin  and mesothelin antigens characteristic of mesothelioma.  They are negative for Ber-Ep 4 adenocarcinoma antigen  and negative for TTF-1 antigen occurring in most poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinomas of lung.The direct smears and cytospin smears contain a similar population of large atypical cells  including a few trabecular sheets and groups of cells in crowded two or three-dimensional arrangements.  No papillary or tubuloglandular structures are noted.  (FDC/nm)

RIGHT LUNG MASS:1.  Non-small cell carcinoma  favor poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.CONSULTATION: Frank Curl  MD
PELVIC MASS  NEEDLE CORE BIOPSY:1.  Poorly differentiated carcinoma (see microscopic description and comment).  COMMENT:  The histologic appearance is that of a poorly differentiated carcinoma.  The immunohistochemical profile with both cytokeratin 7 and cytokeratin 20 expression and positive staining for p63 and CK 5/6 are features that would fit with a transitional cell carcinoma.  Correlation with clinical findings pertaining to the kidneys  ureters and bladder as a possible primary source would be recommended.  The immunohistochemical findings of negative PSA and PSAP would argue against a prostatic adenocarcinoma origin.  Absence of villin and cdx-2 staining would argue against a gastrointestinal origin.  Negative TTF-1 stain would argue against the unlikely possibility of metastasis from a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of lung origin or thyroid origin.  Evaluation as to other possible primary origins would need to be evaluated on a clinical basis.  CONSULTATION:  Sidney H. Rosenheim  M.D.

BLADDER  BIOPSY:1.  Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma  consistent with metastasis from the patient's previously diagnosed poorly differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma (see microscopic description and comment).COMMENT:  The adenocarcinoma in the current case involves the subepithelial connective tissue and muscularis propria in several of the tissue chips.  In areas that contain surface transitional epithelium  the transitional epithelium has a benign appearance and continuity of the malignancy with this transitional epithelial component cannot be identified.  The malignancy in the current case is negative for cytokeratin 7 and positive for cytokeratin 20.  Adenocarcinomas of primary bladder origin are typically positive for both cytokeratin 7 and cytokeratin 20  whereas adenocarcinomas of colonic origin are typically negative for cytokeratin 7 and positive for cytokeratin 20.  The positive staining for cdx-2 and villin is typically seen in colonic adenocarcinomas but adenocarcinomas of primary bladder origin can show staining with these markers also.  Prostatic adenocarcinoma is excluded on the basis of negative staining for PSA and PSAP.  TTF-1 stain is negative  which would exclude origin from other unlikely adenocarcinoma sources  such as lung or thyroid.The patient has a known history of a poorly differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma which was metastatic to regional lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis in 2005 (SP-05-19775). The slides of the adenocarcinoma in the colon are reviewed and show similar features to those present in the current biopsy.  Given this similar appearance of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with negative cytokeratin 7 and positive cytokeratin 20 immunophenotype  the adenocarcinoma in the current bladder biopsy specimen is consistent with metastasis from this previously diagnosed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of colonic origin.

RIGHT FALLOPIAN TUBE  OVARY AND RIGHT OVARIAN MASS:  Frozen section control FSCA1 and sections A2 through A20 contain pieces of right ovary with additional pieces of fallopian tube in section A2.  The ovary is extensively replaced by a monomorphous epithelial neoplasm with atypical cells in solid nested  trabecular and sheet-like arrangements  partly encompassed by thin branching fibrovascular septa.  These cells have small to moderate amounts of non-vacuolated pale amphophilic or occasionally clear cytoplasm and relatively large irregularly rounded or ovoid nuclei with uniformly dispersed chromatin except for occasionally prominent chromocenters.  Nucleoli are generally prominent and there are up to four mitoses per 10 high power fields.  There is little or no no tumor necrosis.  Some interstitial tissues are sparsely infiltrated by small numbers of lymphocytes  but no granulomas are identified.  No syncytiotrophoblasts  areas of yolk sac tumor differentiation or embryonal carcinoma are identified.  Immunostained sections are also negative for human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) occurring in syncytitial trophoblasts and for cytokeratins AE1/AE3 occurring in yolk sac tumors and embryonal carcinomas.  The tumor does not involve the cortical surface of the ovary or extend into fallopian tube.tissues.  The tumor cells show positive immunostaining for placental alkaline phosphatase and CD117 characteristic of dysgerminoma.  The tumor cells also show positive immunostaining for BerEP4 antigen  usually occurring in adenocarcinoma and have a high mib-1 proliferation rate of 75%.  No cells showing positive immunostaining for alpha-fetoprotein antigen characteristic of yolk sac tumor are identified.  The tumor cells are alson negative for all of the following antigens:  estrogen receptor  progesterone receptor  WT-1 and cytokeratin 7 antigens usually occurring in serous ovarian carcinoma  cytokeratin 20 occurring in mucinous ovarian carcinoma  melan A and S100 protein melanoma antigens  TTF-1 antigen occurring in most non-small cell carcinomas of the lung  and leukocyte common antigen occurring in large cell lymphomas.

LUNG  LEFT UPPER LOBE  POSTERIOR  CORE BIOPSY: 1.  Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
RIGHT FEMORAL HEAD:  1.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma (see comment).Comment: The immunohistochamical staining demonstrate that tumor cells are positive for keratin 7 and negative for keratin 20 and CDX2 (markers of colon origin). The breast markers (Brst2 and ER) are also negative. TTF1 (maker for lung cancer) is also negative. The staining pattern dose not support the breast  colon or lung primary. The other primary possible origins including upper GI/ biliary pancreatic system and endometrium should also be rule out. Recommend clinical correlation.
PLEURAL FLUID:  There are four H&E glass slides from the cell block A1  two direct smears and one cytospin slide.   These show numerous clusters of atypical cells with high N:C ratios  prominent nucleoli  nuclear overlapping or three-dimensional contours and slightly eccentric pale cytoplasm  occasionally vacuolated.  The findings are highly suggestive of an adenocarcinoma or large cell malignancy. The background has abundant blood  scattered leukocytes and fibrin.  Some of the atypical cells have greater than two-fold nuclear variation in size and some mild hyperchromatic changes.A battery of immunoperoxidase stains was performed on the cell block (A1).  The results show that the neoplastic cells are strongly positive with BerEP-4 (favoring an adenocarcinoma) and strongly positive with cytokeratin 7  and WT-1.  Some rare nuclear staining with the estrogen receptor is discerned; however  this is weak  but suggests the possibility of an ovarian primary in view of the fact that the breast marker BRST-2 is negative.  Also  the markers for pulmonary (TTF-1) and gastrointestinal tract (villin) are negative.  40% of the cells are positive with cytokeratin 5/6; however  I am doubtful that this may represent a squamous carcinoma in view of the strongly positive BerEP-4  which is diffusely positive.Control slides worked appropriately.In conclusion  carcinomas which are positive for cytokeratin 7 and negative for cytokeratin 20 include breast carcinoma  non-small cell lung carcinoma  ovarian serous carcinoma  endometrial adenocarcinoma  epithelial mesothelioma  thymoma and bile duct carcinoma.  The neoplastic cells are negative with the calretinin  despite the positivity with WT-1  which is why ovarian serous carcinoma is a possible source for the neoplastic cells.  Nonetheless  clinical correlation is advised to rule out other considerations.  JCH/mjv/nm

ABDOMINAL BIOPSY X3  18 GAUGE CORE SAMPLES  CT-GUIDED:1.  Positive for adenocarcinoma  with foci showing papillary serous features (see comment).Comment:  This appears to be a metastasis within fatty tissue  consistent with omentum.  The single most likely primary with this histologic appearance is ovary  but other possible primaries for papillary adenocarcinoma include endometrium and primary peritoneal.  Much less likely possibilities include breast  lung  pancreas  and thyroid.  Clinical correlation is necessary. This case was reviewed at the Daily Intradepartmental QA Conference.  Results have been called to Dr. Putnam and Dr.Soucy on 1/9/07.
TRANSBRONCHIAL BIOPSY:1.  Papillary adenocarcinoma (see comment).Comment: This may represent a primary pulmonary neoplasm or a metastasis. Other sources of papillary carcinoma other than the lung include thyroid and GYN neoplasms and on rare occasions breast. Several special stains are pending including TTF-1 in order to help determine whether this a primary lung neoplasm or metastasis. The results will be added to this report when available.

The lung tumor exhibits a spindle cell component which is not evident in the gynecologic specimens and the lung tumor is additionally positive for TTF-1  supporting a primary pulmonary origin.  The tumor cells present in the lymph node aspirate are reported to be negative for TTF-1 and positive for cytokeratin and ER.  It is uncertain based on these findings if the tumor present in the neck node represents a metastasis from the lung or endometrium as the negative TTF-1 may represent sampling variation.   Findings were discussed with Dr. Helen Ross on 1-10-07.

LUNG  NEEDLE CORE BIOPSY:1.  Adenocarcinoma  moderately differentiated.Comment:  The pattern is consistent with a primary lung carcinoma.  Please correlate clinically.
PLEURAL FLUID  RIGHT LUNG:  Sections reveal clusters of atypical epithelioid cells with a three-dimensional architecture  nuclear hyperchromasia  as well as increased N:C ratio  consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma. Fragments of liver tissue cores are also present.  (jla)
RIGHT LUNG MASS  CORE BIOPSY:1.  Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.Comment:  This case was reviewed at the Daily Intradepartmental QA Conference.  In correlation with the reported CT scan finding of multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules  the pattern is consistent with metastatic neoplasm.  The tumor is poorly differentiated  such that no specific primary site comes to mind.  A panel of immunostains to assess specific differentiation is pending with results to follow in an addendum.
A)  LEFT CERVICAL LYMPH NODE:  A small lymph node shows metastatic large cell malignancy composed of solid nests of large cells with moderately pleomorphic nuclei having at least twofold or greater variation in nuclear size.  Most of the nuclei are oval and many have small to large nucleoli.  The cytoplasm is ill-defined pale pink and the tumor is in the subcapsular sinus of the lymph node  confined to the lymph node.  The perinodal fat is unremarkable.A battery of immunoperoxidase stains was performed on block A2  since this patient has an unknown primary neoplasm  according to the clinician.  The results of the stains show that the malignant cells are positive with cytokeratin 7 and BerEP-4.  The tumor is negative with S-100  PSA  PSAP  villin  cytokeratin 20 and TTF-1 immunoperoxidase stains.  Thus  possible consideration in the differential diagnosis includes lung carcinoma (non-small cell type); however  the TTF-1 (pulmonary marker) is negative in this case and does not completely support a lung primary.  This does not exclude the possibility of a lung primary.  Other entities in the differential diagnosis for entities positive for CK7 and negative for CK20 include epithelial mesothelioma  thymoma and bile duct carcinoma.A review of the two positive antibodies on ImmunoQuery.com shows that the differential diagnosis includes combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma  gastric adenocarcinoma  lung carcinoma  pancreatic carcinoma  peritoneal primary adenocarcinoma  small intestinal adenocarcinoma  metastatic  and cholangiocarcinoma as possibilities.  Other entities are less likely  such as renal cell carcinoma  chromophobe type.  A calretinin and WT-1 are pending for completeness to evaluate mesothelial primary.B)  LEFT BASE OF TONGUE TISSUE:  There are two biopsies of stratified squamous mucosa  negative for high grade dysplasia or malignancy.  There is mild reactive atypia of the basal layers.  The underlying stroma has a patchy lymphocytic- plasmacytic response.  There are a few congested capillaries.  Deeper levels show two minute germinal follicles in the lymphoid component.  C)  NASOPHARYNX TISSUE:  Two biopsies show benign pseudostratified ciliated respiratory mucosa which overlies a patchy lymphoid reaction.  The lymphocytes are mostly small  mature and are intermixed with some plasma cells and sparse histiocytes.  Malignancy is not identified.  D)  LEFT CERVICAL LYMPH NODE:  The bisected lymph node is negative for malignancy and is partially fat-replaced (0/1).  (mgh)

The pleura is moderately anthracotic and mostly smooth with a small umbilicated focus on the lateral aspect of the superior segment.  The pleura in this area is marked and the specimen is sectioned revealing an ill-defined  gray-tan 2.2 cm in greatest dimension tumor.  A frozen section of this area is taken as well as a frozen section of the bronchial margin.Attached at the bronchial margin is a 3 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm wedge of lung which has a stapled margin.  This appears to be from another lobe.  The bronchi are opened revealing glistening tan mucosa throughout.  The cut surfaces of the rest of the lung are soft  tan-pink and crepitant with hemorrhage in the basal aspect of the anterior basal segment.

Immunohistochemical profile is supportive of a pulmonary primary.B)  OUTSIDE SLIDES REPRESENTING LEFT BREAST LUMPECTOMY:1.  Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (see comment).Comment:  The tumor present in the breast material is histologically essentially identical to that in the lung biopsy specimen.  The tumor present in the lung biopsy is strongly TTF-1 positive  supporting a pulmonary primary.  There is a comment in the report provided for the lung biopsy material that the breast tumor is additionally positive for TTF-1; however  this slide is not provided for review.  An attempt will be made to obtain the TTF-1 slide on the breast material to confirm this finding. Presuming that the breast tumor is TTF-1 positive as well  this would be compatible with a metastasis from a pulmonary primary.  The findings were discussed with Dr. Handy on 11/15/06.

Infiltrating adenocarcinoma (see comment).COMMENT:  The infiltrating adenocarcinoma present in B  soft tissue from behind the ear  and in C  biopsy from the arm  are both morphologically similar.  Special stains on C  biopsy from the arm  show the neoplasm is pancytokeratin positive  CK7 positive  CK20 negative  and TTF-1 positive  with negative staining for PSA  cdx-2 and villin.  The  morphology  and the immunohistochemistry profile are consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma  probably from a lung primary (TTF positivity strongly correlates with lung and thyroid origin carcinomas).COMMENT:  Interpreted by James B.

The immunohistochemical profile of CK7 positive  CK20 negative  EMA positive and TTF positive  in a mucin positive carcinoma suggests metastasis from a lung primary. TTF positivity is a strong indicator for pulmonary and thyroid carcinomas.Interpreted by James B. Durham  M.D.  Dermatopathologist
RIGHT UPPER LOBE  LUNG NODULE BIOPSY:1.  Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.2.  Immunohistochemical stains are pending; an addendum report will follow.
20 GAUGE LUNG CORE:1.  Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Comment:  This case was reviewed at the Daily Intradepartmental QA Conference. Additional immunostudies may be performed at the request of the clinician  if there is clinical suspicion that this is a metastatic lesion.
A)  LEFT LUNG LOWER LOBE  LOBECTOMY:1.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma  moderately differentiated  consistent with colorectal primary  with negative surgical margin and negative pleural surface.2.  No metastasis to eleven lymph nodes (0/11).B)  STATION 11L LYMPH NODE:1.  No metastasis to four lymph nodes (0/4).C)  STATION 9 LYMPH NODE:1.  No metastasis to one lymph node (0/1).
LIVER  NEEDLE CORE BIOPSIES:1.  Metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma (see microscopic description and comment).COMMENT:  The patient has a clinical history of both colonic adenocarcinoma with metastasis to two of twenty-two colonic lymph nodes (SP-06-4888) as well as poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma of the lung (SP-06-1877).  The patient's prior lung cancer received immunohistochemical work-up; this prior lung cancer was found to be positive for cytokeratin 7 and TTF-1 as well as negative for cytokeratin 20 and CDX-2.  The patient's current liver core biopsy tumor is positive for CDX-2 and cytokeratin 20 as well as negative for cytokeratin 7 and TTF-1.  The histologic appearance and immunohistochemical profile in the current liver core biopsy tumor is that of a metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma.
A)  LEFT UPPER LOBE EXCISION:  The specimen  which is received fresh for a frozen section diagnosis labeled Groves  Billie J.  consists of a 10 x 3 x 2 cm wedge resection of lung tissue  the pleura of which reveals a surgically stapled margin of resection and a focal fragmentation.The pleura is inked blue and the surgical staples are trimmed from the specimen.  The margin created by the removal of the staples from the specimen is inked black.Sectioning reveals a 1 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm white-tan nodule which most closely approximates the stapled margin of resection by 0.6 cm.  The remaining cut surfaces of the wedge resection appear unremarkable.  A section of the nodule is embedded for a frozen section diagnosis; additional sections are submitted including the nodule in its entirety.FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:  CARCINOMA  FAVOR ADENOCARCINOMA.  (MKL)SECTIONS:A1)  frozen section control;A2)-A3)  remainder of nodule;A4)-A6)  additional representative.
BRONCHIAL WASHING:1.  Acute leukemia infiltrate (see microscopic description and comment).COMMENT:  In the cytology smears and cytospin preparations are markedly atypical cells which are interpreted to be cytologically malignant.  No clinical history was provided and on the cytology preparations alone  the differential diagnosis would include adenocarcinoma.  However  review of the patient's clinical history yielded a peripheral blood flow cytometry report which documented an undifferentiated acute leukemia.  Review of the patient's chest CT report and pulmonary consultation report described infiltrates in the lung which were concerning for a possible component of this leukemic process.  The finding of a population of cells which are positive for CD34  TdT  CD43 and CLA in the cell block sections of the bronchial wash specimen is a similar immunohistochemical phenotype to that seen in the leukemic cells in the peripheral blood flow cytometry. Based on this  these cells in the bronchial washing specimen are interpreted to represent a component of this acute leukemic infiltrate also.  CONSULTATION:  P. Holbrook Howard  M.D.
LUNG  LEFT  NEEDLE CORE BIOPSIES (2):1.  Lung with areas of dense fibrosis demonstrating invasive adenocarcinoma with papillary features. Comment:  This case was reviewed at the Daily Intradepartmental QA Conference.
There are many three dimensional clusters of atypical cells with pleomorphic nuclei and prominent nucleoli  most consistent with adenocarcinoma. The site of origin is unclear and cannot be elucidated from this sample. Possibilities could include a lung or breast primary. Clinical correlation recommended.

SECTIONS:A1) and A2)  submitted in toto.B)  RIGHT UPPER LOBE (FS):  Received fresh for intraoperative consultation by frozen section is a 3.5 x 2.0 x 0.8 cm wedge-shaped biopsy of lung parenchyma with overlying stapled margins.  The entire surface is inked blue and the staples are removed.  The pleura is gray-tan and smooth.  The cut surface displays a 0.5 cm yellow-tan firm lesion which is 0.2 cm from the inked margin and 0.1 cm from the pleural surface..  The remaining parenchyma is crepitant and red-tan.  The specimen is representatively submitted.  FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:  B)  RIGHT UPPER LOBE WEDGE BIOPSY:  ADENOCARCINOMA.  (FDC - 9/11/06)SECTIONS:B1)  frozen section control;B2)-B3)  remainder of sections  perpendicular to stapled margin.C)  RIGHT UPPER LOBE (PERMANENT):  Received in a prefilled formalin container labeled Moloney  Mirradel is a 3.5 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm wedge-shaped biopsy of lung parenchyma with a purple  gray-tan pleura displaying a 0.7 x 0.5 cm gray-white firm plaque-like lesion which is 0.5 cm from the stapled margin.  The entire pleura is inked blue.  The staples are removed and the margin is submitted en face.  The remaining tissue is sectioned perpendicular to the staple lines revealing a solid gray-tan mass measuring 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm.  The remaining cut surface is pink-tan.  SECTIONS:C1)  en face margin;C2) and C3)  remainder of tissue  perpendicular sections through margin.
LUNG NODULE BIOPSY:1.  Well-differentiated adenocarcinoma  see comment.COMMENT:  The tumor present in this material has a morphologic pattern of mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma.  This may not be representative of the entire tumor  however.   The patient's history of prostate cancer is noted.  Immunohistochemical studies support a pulmonary primary and prostate markers are negative.
A)  THORACENTESIS FLUID (FROM SYRINGE):  One cytospin and two direct smears are received.  There is no cell block.  There are scattered benign-appearing isolated and small sheets of bland-appearing mesothelial cells in a background of scattered lymphocytes  most of which are small and mature.  In slide A1  the direct smear  there are a few two-dimensional aggregates of large cells with mild nuclear pleomorphism.  These have slightly hypochromatic chromatin and small to inconspicuous nucleoli.  These atypical cells are consistent with the atypical cells in the cell block of part B. B)  THORACENTESIS FLUID (FROM BOTTLE):  There are two H&E slides from the cell block B1  one cytospin and two direct smears.  The cell block shows numerous small mature lymphocytes intermixed with benign-appearing mesothelial cells and some clusters of larger cells with intercellular spaces.  These rounded two-dimensional nests have large cells  some of which are columnar in shape.  There is mild nuclear pleomorphism and occasional single or double small nucleoli.  The chromatin is slightly coarse.  The cytoplasm is pink and ill-defined.  Many of the cells in the direct air-dried smear are not well preserved.  A battery of immunoperoxidase stains is performed on the cell block  which exhibited atypical cells consistent with cytologic malignant change.  The results of these stains show that the neoplastic cells are strongly positive with cytokeratin AE1/AE3  cytokeratin 7  and estrogen receptor.  Also some of the cells are positive with WT-1.  The cells are negative with keratin 20  CEA  villin  TTF-1  calretinin  mesothelin  BRST-2.Malignancies which are cytokeratin 7 positive and cytokeratin 20 negative include breast carcinoma  lung carcinoma  ovarian serous carcinoma  endometrial adenocarcinoma  epithelial mesothelioma  thymoma  and bile duct carcinomas.  Because this tumor demonstrated estrogen receptor positivity  breast and ovarian serous carcinomas are in the differential diagnosis.  This is not likely to be lung carcinoma due to the negative TTF-1.  Ovarian serous carcinomas may express both ER and WT-1.   Breast carcinomas may express WT-1 in 22% of the cases  based on information obtained from Immunoquery.  JCH/mjv

20 GAUGE BIOPSY  CORE X4  LUNG LESION:1.  Moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma  pending additional studies.Comment:  Immunohistochemical studies will be performed to better characterize the origin of this tumor and this report will be addended.
LIVER  RIGHT LOBE  NEEDLE CORE BIOPSIES:1.  Metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma (see microscopic description and comment).COMMENT:  The H&E sections show focal changes suggestive of glandular differentiation.  This feature  combined with the positive BerEP4 and focally positive CEA  would favor poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  The immunohistochemical profile is inconclusive as to the primary site.  The patient's history of a 3.8 cm right upper lobe lung mass is noted.  Approximately 25% of pulmonary adenocarcinomas can be negative for TTF-1; however  the negative cytokeratin 7 staining and focal weakly positive cytokeratin 20 staining would be unusual for a pulmonary adenocarcinoma.  Negative cdx-2 and villin stains argue against a gastrointestinal primary origin.  Negative CD117 argues against an epithelioid gastrointestinal stromal tumor.  Negative Heppar argues against a hepatocellular carcinoma.  Negative PSA argues against a prostatic primary source.CONSULTATION:  Mary Beth Beasley  M.D.

The cells occasionally form rudimentary tubuloglandular-appearing structures.  There is no evident cytoplasmic mucinous vacuolization or keratinization.  Mitoses are rare. A small renal vein is apparently invaded by tumor.  There are occasional foci of confluent tumor cell necrosis.  The atypical cells show positive immunostaining for CD10 antigen frequently occurring in renal cell carcinoma  but are negative for renal cell carcinoma antigen and for vimentin coexpression characteristic of renal cell carcinoma.  They are immunopositive for P63 antigen occurring in transitional cell urothelial carcinomas  but are negative for cytokeratins 7 and 20 usually seen in transitional cell carcinoma.  The cells are negative for TTF-1 antigen occurring in non-small cell lung carcinoma  negative for synaptophysin neuroendocrine tumor antigen  negative for Ber-EP4 adenocarcinoma antigen and negative for melanoma antigens melan-A and S-100 protein. The tumor exhibits stromal desmoplasia with acute and chronic inflammatory infiltrates  including numerous plasmacytes.  The tissues include a few normal glomerular and renal tubular remnants.
LEFT LUNG  CORE BIOPSY:1.  Well-differentiated adenocarcinoma.Comment:  Dr.  Mary Beth Beasley  expert in pulmonary pathology  agrees with the diagnosis.
LEFT LOWER LOBE LUNG BIOPSY:  Sections demonstrate fragments of bronchial wall.  All of the fragments are evolved to varying degrees by a poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma.  The tumor is present predominantly within lymphatic spaces  but is focally within the connective tissue as well.  Some of the cells appear to have intracytoplasmic vacuoles suggesting adenocarcinoma  but definitive differentiation is not observed.

A)  RIGHT UPPER LOBE:  A circumscribed area of lung is involved by adenocarcinoma.  Essentially  the entire tumor is composed of neoplastic glands that show some complex branching and infolding.  There is a fibrotic area in the center.  Nuclear features are intermediate grade.  The tumor comes very close to the pleural surface  with some associated retraction  but with no penetration of tumor onto the surface.  The non-neoplastic lung includes pigmented intra-alveolar macrophages and some minor emphysematous change.  No tumor is seen at the bronchial margin  correlating with the frozen section diagnosis.  Nine lymph nodes are negative for metastasis.B)  MEDIASTINAL LYMPH NODES:  Eight lymph nodes are free of metastasis.

Carcinoid tumorlets are also present.Comment:  This case was reviewed at the Daily Intradepartmental QA Conference. CONSULT: Dr. Mary Beth Beasley.
RIGHT UPPER LOBE WEDGE RESECTION:  There are multiple rounded nodules of adenocarcinoma in the lung parenchyma  not clearly interconnected as sectioned. The tumor is predominantly cribriform with solid areas and foci of necrosis.  Tumor cells have pale cytoplasm and round central nuclei that often have a macronucleolus.  A panel of immunostains is undertaken to further characterize the lesion.  The tumor cells are positive for PSA and PAP  and negative for CK7  CK20  and TTF-1.
WEDGE  RIGHT UPPER LOBE:  The specimen  which is received fresh for a frozen section diagnosis  identified with the patient's name of Barrett  Thomas Michael  consists of a 6.5 x 4 x 1.5 cm wedge resection of the lung  the pleura of which reveals a surgically stapled margin of resection.The pleura is inked and the staples are trimmed from the specimen.  The margin of resection is embedded en face for a frozen section diagnosis.  Sectioning reveals a well-circumscribed 1.3 cm subpleural white-tan nodule which most closely approximates the margin of resection by 0.7 cm.  The remaining cut surfaces appear unremarkable.  A section of the tumor is also embedded for a frozen section diagnosis.  Additional sections are submitted.FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:  FS (REPRESENTATIVE OF TUMOR AND STAPLED MARGIN EN FACE):1.  ADENOCARCINOMA.2.

Right fallopian tube -- focal adenocarcinoma on serosal surface (see comment).9.  Adenocarcinoma involving soft tissue from right adnexa and separate soft tissue fragments within container (see comment).COMMENT: Per the surgeon  a recent CT scan showed only a large pancreatic mass but no other lesions were reported. The adenocarcinoma in all sites listed has the same histologic appearance. Based on the immunohistochemical profile  origin from a colonic or mesothelial primary source is ruled out. The focal involvement of serosal surfaces only in the ovaries  as well as the absence of estrogen receptor staining and presence of focal staining for CEA  would not fit with origin from an ovarian primary source. The absence of TTF-1 staining  as well as the lack of radiologic evidence of a lung lesion  argues against a pulmonary primary source. The presence of some staining with CEA  as well as the lack of radiologic evidence of a breast lesion  argues against a breast primary source. Given the presence of a pancreatic mass on CT scan  a pancreatic primary would be the most likely source for the adenocarcinoma  as these tumors are typically CK7 and CEA positive and often CK20 negative; however  the histologic appearance and immunohistochemical profile is not specific for pancreatic carcinoma  as other upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas (such as esophageal  gastric and biliary tract adenocarcinomas) can have a similar histologic and immunohistochemical appearance. Therefore  these other possible primary sources would need to be excluded on a clinical basis. CONSULTATION: Xiaohong Cai  M.D.  Ph.D

PLEURAL FLUID:1.  Adenocarcinoma  consistent with pulmonary origin (see microscopic description and comment).COMMENT:  The immunohistochemical stains demonstrate that the cellular proliferation is of epithelial rather than mesothelial origin.  The patient does have a clinical history of infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast in 2002 as well as a current right upper lobe lung mass and hilar adenopathy.  The finding of strong BerEP4 positive staining fits with adenocarcinoma; however  the cytokeratin 7 positive/cytokeratin 20 negative profile can be seen in either breast adenocarcinomas or lung adenocarcinomas.  However  the estrogen receptor staining in the current case is negative  whereas the patient's previous breast cancer was estrogen receptor positive; BRST-2 is also negative in the current case.  Scattered weakly positive nuclear staining is seen in some cells with the TTF-1 stain.  Based on the clinical history and these cytologic and immunohistochemical findings  the features of adenocarcinoma would fit with origin from a pulmonary primary course.CONSULTATION:  Mary Beth Beasley  M.D.

A)-B)-C)  OCCIPITAL TUMOR  TUMOR #2  AND TUMOR #3:  Microscopic examination of all three of these tumors reveals the same histological findings.  Present are pieces of CNS tissue showing metastatic carcinoma  having a distinctive papillary type of architecture with fibrovascular cores and covered by epithelium showing signet ring formation. Mucicarmine stain is positive for mucin in the tumor cells. CK7 is strongly positive and CK20 is focally positive  pan keratin is positive  TTF-1 is positive and GFAP negative. This immunophenotypical profile is that of adenocarcinoma and the positive TTF-1 suggests lung or thyroid as possible sources for the primary tumor.

LEFT LUNG NODULE BIOPSY:1.  Well-differentiated adenocarcinoma.
PLEURAL FLUID:  There are four H&E glass slides from the cell block A1  one cytospin smear  and two direct smears.  The direct smears and cell block have cohesive clusters of atypical cells suspicious for an adenocarcinoma.  These have eccentric oval enlarged nuclei  hyperchromatic nuclei with small nucleoli and occasionally bold nuclear membranes.  The cytoplasm is vacuolated.  The direct smears  particularly the Papanicolaou smear  show three-dimensional clusters.  The background has some isolated benign mesothelial cells  neutrophils and lymphocytes.  There is at least two-fold nuclear variation in size in the atypical cytologically malignant cells.SPECIAL STAIN RESULTS:  A battery of immunoperoxidase stains was performed  and the results show that the atypical cells  which are cytologically malignant  stain with cytokeratin AE1/AE3  keratin 7  and BerEP-4.  The cells are negative with cytokeratin 20  estrogen receptor  BRST-2  villin  mesothelin  calretinin and S-100 immunoperoxidase stains.  The neoplasm  however  is strongly positive with TTF-1  a nuclear stain for pulmonary primary (and thyroid primary).  Given the location of these cells in pleural fluid  a lung primary is the most likely in this case.  Clinical correlation is advised.  JCH/mjv

LUNG NODULE BIOPSY:1.  Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.2.  Immunohistochemical stains are pending and an addendum report will follow.
NEEDLE BIOPSY OF LEFT CHEST WALL:1.  Extensive  malignant neoplasm consistent with a poorly differentiated carcinoma (see comment).COMMENT:  Although this histology suggests an adenocarcinoma  a battery of immunostains is pending for further evaluation.  If this is an unknown primary  breast and lung are likely  candidates given the location of the biopsy.  An addendum will follow with special stain results.CONSULTATION:  Mary Beth Beasley  M.D.  pending
BIOPSY OF TISSUE FROM UNSPECIFIED SITE:  There are up to five core biopsies of bony tissue.  The bony trabeculae are viable.  There is sparse fat and poorly preserved hematopoietic tissue in the marrow.  Also  there are specks of cohesive to discohesive monotonous cells consistent with metastatic carcinoma.  One of these forms a vague gland.  The columnar cells have ill-defined pink cytoplasm  mildly to moderately enlarged nuclei  and small to inconspicuous nucleoli.SPECIAL STAIN RESULTS:  A battery of immunostains was performed on block A1.  The results show that the neoplasm is negative with PSA and PSAP (prostatic markers) and negative with Villin (gastrointestinal marker).  The neoplasm is strongly positive with cytokeratin 7 and positive with cytokeratin AE1/AE3.  The tumor is weakly positive with cytokeratin 20.  Under these circumstances  a prostatic primary is unlikely since most prostatic carcinomas are negative with both cytokeratins 7 and 20  and the prostatic markers are negative in this case.  Thus  given the clinical history of an esophageal adenocarcinoma primary  another battery was performed.  (mgh)A second battery of immunostains was performed which includes CDX-2  CEA and TTF-1 on block A1.  The results show that the neoplastic cells are strongly positive with TTF-1 (a pulmonary marker  which stains thyroid carcinomas  also).  The tumor does not exist in the section with the CEA stain.  The section with the CDX-2 immunostain shows only a speck of neoplasm for evaluation.  This speck of neoplasm is negative with the CDX-2 immunoperoxidase stain  a colorectal marker.  Thus  in conclusion  the metastatic carcinoma may represent a lung primary and this should be correlated  clinically.  (mjv)

FNA  DESIGNATED LEFT LUNG MASS:1.  Inconclusive - Highly atypical discohesive cells of uncertain classification  see comment.  Comment:  Following intramural consultation  there is no concensus of opinion and I have been unable to obtain a cell block from this material  as discussed with Dr. Bowerfind.  Without a cell block  I cannot obtain immunoperoxidase stains reliably since there are not enough cells in some of the unstained cytospin smears.  This case has received intramural consultation from two other cytopathologists  including Dr. Su Wang who cannot exclude a  mesothelioma  and Dr. James Booth  who favors a diagnosis of atypical cells  resembling type 2 pneumocytes (with a differential diagnosis to include sclerosing hemangioma  bronchioalveolar adenocarcinoma  carcinoid  and  less likely  inflammatory pseudotumor with alveolar metaplasia).  Dr. Mary Beth Beasley  pulmonary pathologist  favors a non-small cell carcinoma.  In my opinion  the extensive discohesive nature of this cytology suggests that this may not represent a carcinoma  but something different - either a mesothelioma or atypical type 2 pneumocytes.  Under these circumstances  a tissue biopsy is strongly recommended to obtain a definitive diagnosis  as I have discussed with Dr. Bowerfind by telephone.

A)  LEFT UPPER LOBE WEDGE:  This is a wedge of lung tissue received fresh for frozen section in a container labeled Pauline Margaret Drew.  The specimen is 4.8 x 3 x 1.7 cm.  A large incision is found exposing a cavitary mass.  This mass appears to extend to a suture line.  The mass is approximately 1.7 cm in greatest dimension.  Since the specimen is received previously incised  the pleura is difficult to assess but the tumor appears to abut the pleura.  The remaining specimen is grossly unremarkable.  An attempt is made to stain the pleura adjacent to the incision to assess tumor involvement.  Green dye is used for this purpose.  No other abnormality is identified.FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:  ADENOCARCINOMA (ARS).SECTIONS:A1)  residual tissue submitted for frozen section;A2)-A3)  essentially all of the remaining tumor with green stained pleura;A4)  a random section taken away from the tumor.B)  LEFT UPPER LOBE:  This specimen is received fresh and placed in formalin in a container labeled Pauline Margaret Drew.  This is a 120 gm apparent left upper lobe.  The specimen is 24 x 10 x 4.3 cm.  A 12 cm wire suture line runs along the posterior/superior edge of the specimen.  This wire suture line is also found 5 cm from the bronchial resection margin.  The bronchi are patent.  The hilar lymph nodes are anthracotic.  Prior to dissection  the pleura over the wire suture line is stained with black dye.  Otherwise  the pleura is smooth.  The entire specimen is crepitant throughout.  No suspicious area is identified.

This is a 1 cm anthracotic lymph node surrounded by fat.SECTIONS:C)  entirely submitted.D)  LEFT UPPER LOBE  STATION 5 AND 6 LYMPH NODES:  The specimen is received fresh in a container labeled Pauline Margaret Drew and placed in formalin and consists of three portions of tissue dissected for lymph nodes.  Four anthracotic lymph nodes are identified.SECTIONS:D)  all submitted.
RIGHT LOWER LOBE BRONCHUS ENDOBRONCHIAL BIOPSY:  These sections reveal fragments of bronchial wall as well as some detached fragments consisting of blood and fibrin.  In one of the fragments  there is a focal area of surface erosion and underlying cellular proliferation.  These cells exhibit some variation in size and shape and sometimes appear somewhat spindled.  A cytokeratin immunostain is performed  and these cells are negative; this appears to be a benign fibroblastic proliferation.  One of the fragments contains some underlying mucinous glands.  These glands appear to be producing fair amounts of mucin; these glands  however  exhibit normal overall architecture and no significant cytologic atypia.  No evidence of malignancy is seen.  The patient's previous lung adenocarcinoma is noted and the slides reviewed (SV-03-9138).  No granulomas are identified.
A)  LEFT LUNG POSTERIOR PLEURA:  Sections prepared from previously frozen and non-frozen tissue demonstrate fibrotically thickened pleura characterized by the presence of an infiltrating  poorly differentiated neoplasm.  This is composed of cords and nodules of malignant cells with ovoid nuclei that have somewhat irregular nuclear membranes.  The malignant nuclei have medium coarse nuclear chromatin and often display a small  centrally located nucleolus.  Abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm is present.  Also present is a large amount of fibrinous exudate and there is mesothelial hyperplasia evident on the pleural surface.B)  ADDITIONAL PLEURA:  The histology is identical to that described in paragraph A.  Chronic inflammation is noted in the retropleural fibroadipose tissue.Block B1 was evaluated with a panel of monoclonal antibodies.  These show the carcinoma to be negative for cytokeratin 7  negative for cytokeratin 20  cytokeratin 5/6 and p63.  The mesothelial cells show some positivity with CK7.  Keratin AE1/AE3 is negative with regard to the neoplasm while mesothelial cells and some stromal cells are positive.  Similar reactions are found with keratin reagent CAM 5.2.  The tumor is also negative for calretinin.On the other hand  the large neoplastic nodules are strongly positive for CD31 and CD34 which are markers of vascular neoplasms.  The neoplasm is negative with the adenocarcinoma markers CDX2 and Ber-EP4.  Negative reactions are also obtained with the melanoma markers S-100 protein and melan-A.  Another mesothelioma marker WT-1 is negative with the normal mesothelium staining positive and serving as an internal positive control.  Finally  the proliferation rate with mib-1 is found to be moderate with 10-20%  or perhaps slightly more the malignant nuclei staining positively.
A)  SUBCARINAL LYMPH NODE  STATION #7:1.  Lymph node negative for malignancy (0/1).B)  RIGHT LOWER LOBE MASS BIOPSY:1.  Metastatic endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma.C)  RIGHT LOWER LOBE  STATION #10 LYMPH NODE:1.  Lymph node with no evidence of malignancy (0/1).D)  RIGHT LOWER LOBE  BRONCHIAL MARGIN (180 GRAMS). LOBECTOMY:1.  Metastatic endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma  FIGO grade 1  size: 3.2 cm in maximum diameter  with satellite nodules (please see staging summary).2.  No evidence of pleural involvement.3.  Bronchial margin negative.  E)  RIGHT LOWER LOBE  STATION #3R AND 4R:1.  Lymph node with no evidence of malignancy (0/1).COMMENT:Immunohistochemical studies are performed on the tumor population and demonstrate it to be negative for TTF-1 and positive for ER and PR.  The absence of TTF-1 expression tends to exclude a lung primary.  The current tumor is also compared to the patient's previous hysterectomy specimen (S96-10807  8/12/96) and the current tumor is morphologically identical to the patient's previous endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma  FIGO grade 1.
