No evidence of residual carcinoma is identified  an impression also supported by the negative keratin stains results.  In summary these  findings are suggestive of a possible previous tumor bed demonstrating evidence of a complete response to presurgical neo-adjuvant therapy.

V1017301073,PETERS  JUDITH LEE,1/31/1950 0:00,F,SV-10-011226,6/25/2010 11:43,BREAST  NEEDLE,Surg Path Dx,MURPHY  BRENDA FAYE,5.28,BIFULCO  CARLO BRUNO,Verified,6/30/2010 18:33,LEFT BREAST  CORE BIOPSY1.  Fragments of an intraductal papillary lesion (see comment)COMMENT: The core biopsy show fragments of an intraductal papillary lesion with areas of epithelial hyperplasia. P63 and SMMHC (myoepithelial cell markers) highlight the presence of myoepithelial cells in the periphery of the ducts and in the fibrovascular cores. The epithelial cells are positive with CK5-6 and CK903. There is no evidence of atypia or malignancy.In summary  the fragments present in this core biopsy material the findings are most consistent with a benign intraductal papilloma with epithelial hyperplasia. Complete excision of papillary lesions is however recommended in order to evaluate the entirety of the lesional process and allow to exclude the presence of atypia or carcinoma.Case seen in consulation with Dr. M. Martel  who concurs with the above interpretation.
