No evidence of residual carcinoma is identified  an impression also supported by the negative keratin stains results.

Fragments of an intraductal papillary lesion (see comment)COMMENT: The core biopsy show fragments of an intraductal papillary lesion with areas of epithelial hyperplasia. P63 and SMMHC (myoepithelial cell markers) highlight the presence of myoepithelial cells in the periphery of the ducts and in the fibrovascular cores. The epithelial cells are positive with CK5-6 and CK903. There is no evidence of atypia or malignancy.In summary  the fragments present in this core biopsy material the findings are most consistent with a benign intraductal papilloma with epithelial hyperplasia. Complete excision of papillary lesions is however recommended in order to evaluate the entirety of the lesional process and allow to exclude the presence of atypia or carcinoma.Case seen in consulation with Dr. M. Martel  who concurs with the above interpretation.,60
