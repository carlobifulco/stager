The epithelioid component is characterized by cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm  vesicular nuclei  mild hyperchromasia  nucleomegaly and few mitotic figures.  The spindle cell component is intimately admixed with the epithelioid component with elongated cells adjacent to epithelioid cells.  Prominent areas of necrosis are present.Immunohistochemical stains along with appropriate controls are performed and show the tumor cells to be positive for keratins cam 5.2 and AE1/AE3 and for mesothelioma markers Calretinin  CK5/6 and focally for D2-40.   Adenocarcinoma stains of TTF1  CD15 and BerEP-4 are negative.  CEA-m  negative.   Due to the previous history of prostate cancer  stains for PSA and PSAP are performed and are negative in the tumor cells.  This immunoprofile supports the above diagnosis.

The remaining of tumor with adjacent uninvolved lung parenchyma measure microscopically 1 cm.   Radiologic correlation is recommended to accurately measure the tumor and if needed to update the stage.Three stapled lines of resection are present in the lobectomy specimen. The en-face sections are submitted in slides C3-C6.  Slide C4 shows focal involvement by the tumor  however  this could represent line of resection of the wedge and not a true margin  as discussed with Dr. Furnary at 2:40 pm on 12/11/09.This resection is compared with the previous resection of SV09-9496.  Although  all tumors are of adenocarcinomas  they are not identical which favor multiple synchronous tumors and should be staged separately.

Adenocarcinoma (see comment).Comment: The adenocarcinoma is present within the stroma of the cervical biopsy and does not involve the overlying mucosa. The histological pattern is somewhat different than the usual appearing cervical adenocarcinoma. For these reasons a battery of immunohistochemical stains  was obtained with the following results: CK7+ CK20- CDX2- TTF-1- BRST-2- mammaglobin- WT- synaptophysin-CA125+ P16+ vimentin+ ER+ CEA+ and mucicarmine+. This profile is consistent with a primary cervical adenocarcinoma and tends to exclude metastatic lung  breast and GI primaries as well as endometrial carcinoma. Nevertheless  a metastatic lesion cannot be completely excluded.

Immunoperoxidase stains are positive for CD 56 and non-reactive for synaptophysin  chromogranin  CK 7/20 and CD 45. This pattern suggests a neuroendocrine component. The majority of the biopsy is necrotic debris. Comparing the features with those from the needle biopsy of the subcarinal lymph node NP-09-1906 which shows an adenocarcinoma  raises the possibility of a dimorphic tumor versus two distinct malignancies.

Metastatic adenocarcinoma  consistent with ovarian primary origin (see comment).COMMENT: The immunohistochemical profile of positive CK7 and negative CK20 can be seen in adenocarcinomas of lung  breast  upper gastrointestinal and gynecologic primary origins. The positive estrogen receptor staining and absence of staining for TTF-1 rules out a lung primary. The positive estrogen receptor staining also rules out an upper gastrointestinal primary. The lack of staining for BRST-2 and mammaglobin does not give support for a breast primary and some sources have implicated that positive CD117 staining  as seen here  would argue against a breast primary. The patient's recent abdominal CT report of 9/18/2009 is reviewed on Physician Portal and this describes a large right ovarian mass which is continguous with the uterus  as well as peritoneal studding consistent with metastatic disease. In the differential of ovarian versus endometrial primary tumors  some sources have implicated that positive E-cadherin staining  as seen here  would support an ovarian over endometrial primary source. Also  positive staining for CD117  as seen here  can often be seen in non-mucinous ovarian tumors. WT-1 is negative  as expected as the histologic features in the tumor as sampled here would favor endometrioid morphology rather than serous.In summary  the histologic features and immunohistochemical profile are those of a metastatic adenocarcinoma  consistent with ovarian primary origin  having features which favor endometrioid morphology based on the portion of the neoplasm represented in this sampling.

Metastatic adenocarcinoma with intestinal-like histologic features (see microscopic description and comment).COMMENT: The metastatic adenocarcinoma in this case has intestinal-like features with cytoplasmic goblet cell appearance in some areas. Strongly positive CK7 staining with weaker CK20 staining can be seen in adenocarcinomas of the upper gastrointestinal tract and this pattern would argue against a colonic primary source; however  appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinomas can show a higher proportion of CK7 positivity and less prominent CK20 staining and these tumors tend to show a brush border pattern on villin stain  as was seen here. Strongly positive CDX2 staining is also typical with gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas. Upper GI sources to rule out would include esophagus and stomach; pancreatic adenocarcinomas usually show cytoplasmic staining with villin  rather than the brush border pattern seen here  and the pancreas is described as normal on the patient's recent abdominal CT report of 9/20/2009. This histologic pattern and CK7/CK20 profile can also be seen in mucinous carcinomas of ovarian origin. Positive CDX2 staining can also be seen with mucinous ovarian carcinomas. However  ovarian mucinous carcinomas tend to show cytoplasmic staining without brush border reactivity with villin. Also  no ovarian masses are described in the recent pelvic CT report of 9/20/2009. This CK7/CK20 pattern can also be seen in carcinomas of breast ductal origin; however  this intestinal-like morphology would be unusual for a breast carcinoma and the absence of staining for estrogen receptor  BRST-2 and mammaglobin do not lend support for a breast primary. Given the presence of a large mass in the right lung with invasion into the hilum and mediastinum described on the chest CT of 9/20/2009  an enteric (intestinal-like) adenocarcinoma of primary lung origin would be in the differential  as these can show a CK7 positive/ CK20 positive profile with positive CDX2 staining and can closely imitate gastrointestinal primary adenocarcinomas in metastatic sites.In summary  in this metastatic adenocarcinoma with intestinal-like histologic features  primary origin from upper gastrointestinal sources such as esophagus and stomach would need to be ruled out on a clinincal basis. A pancreatic primary source appears unlikely based on the negative radiologic imaging impression. An appendical primary source would need to be excluded on a clinical basis but primary sources from elsewhere in the colon have been ruled out based on these findings. A mucinous ovarian primary source appears unlikely based on the findings here as well as on the negative radiologic imaging impression. An enteric (intestinal-like) adenocarcinoma of primary lung origin is in the differential based on the pathologic findings and the presence of a large lung mass; however  the other gastrointestinal primary sources listed above must first be excluded clinically.

The submitted sections show four needle core biopsies of fibrotic tissue heavily involved by sheets of neoplastic cells with high N:C ratios and nuclei that vary moderately in size and shape with clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm and abundant necrosis.  A fragment of skeletal muscle and fibroadipose tissue is present and free of tumor.Immunohistochemical stains along with appropriate controls are performed at our institution and show the tumor cells to be strongly positive for CK7 and ER while being negative for TTF-1  CK20  P63  CK5/6  PR and mCEA.  This immunoprofile is in support of metastasis from uterine primary.Immunohistochemical stains also have been performed on the previous uterine carcinoma (SP09-18341) and show a similar immunoprofile of tumor cells strongly positive for CK7 and ER  while being negative for TTF-1 and PR  with focal positivity for monoclonal CEA.  Of note  lung adenocarcinoma are usually strongly positive for mCEA while endometrioid adenocarcinomas are either negative or focally positive.COMMENT:  A concurring second opinion has been rendered by Dr. Maritza Martel  OB/GYN Pathologist   who reviewed this case at St. Vincent's daily conference.

Adenocarcinoma  moderately differentiated  see comment.COMMENT:  The biopsy material demonstrates the presence of sparse  atypical glandular structures  inserted into a hyalinized fibrotic background.  The glandular lining epithelium is characterized by pleomorphic nuclei  relatively prominent nucleoli and abundant cytoplasm.  Mitotic figures are not easily identified.  The performed immunohistochemical stains demonstrate that the neoplastic elements are positive for CK7  TTF-1  show focal minimal patchy positivity for P63 and are characterized by an increased proliferative index  as assessed by a stain for Ki-67.  Stains for cytokeratin 20  CMV  herpes and P53 are negative.  Minimal patchy positivity for BerEP-4 is present.  In summary  these morphologic and immunophenotypic findings are most consistent with involvement by an adenocarcinoma associated with scar-like stromal changes.  Correlation with the clinical findings is recommended.Case seen in consultation with Dr. F. Curl  Dr. S. Hussein and Dr. Y. Wu  who concur with this interpretation.

Both described tumors are identical adenocarcinoma of mixed subtypes: acinar (90%) and solid (10%) patterns.  Both tumors show association with central scar  moderate lymphoid hyperplasia and scattered psammomatous type microcalcifications.  Both tumors appear to involve the adjacent emphysematous lung tissue.  Note:  Per submitted report of the gross description  there are two tumor foci.  One of the foci is present at least 2.4 cm away from the other tumor focus.  Also  the gross description of part 3 mentions that cassette (3F) represents a random section of pulmonary parenchyma away from the mass; however  this section is  of a tumor focus also.  It is not clear whether this is the same area of fibrosis representing thickened alveolar wall  as described grossly in part 1  or a random section that was not identified grossly as a tumor.  An attempt is made to reach Dr. Sanborn at 3:00 p.m. on 8/5/2009.

The articular cartilage shows areas of irregular erosion and thinning.  Some of the medullary bone trabeculae are thin and widely spaced. The intramedullary tissues are fibrotic with no apparent hematopoietic activity.  There is a sclerotic 5.0 mm intramedullary focus of metastatic carcinoma bordered by fresh hemorrhage and a separate  2.0 mm intramedullary focus of similar tumor in another bone fragment.  Section A2 contains pieces of bone with relatively large amounts of sclerotic intramedullary tissue showing extensive involvement by metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma.  The tumor contains numerous small nests and thin strands of intermediate size atypical cells having moderate amounts of nonvacuolated  pale eosinophilic cytoplasm and irregularly rounded  ovoid or occasionally angulated nuclei with evenly dispersed chromatin  and predominantly indistinct nucleoli.  Mitoses are rare.  The tumor cells show positive immunostaining for cytokeratins AE!/AE3 and focal weak immunostaining for cytokeratin 20  but are negative for cytokeratin 7 usually present in breast carcinomas.  There is positive immunostaining  however for E-cadherin antigen characteristic of ductal carcinoma of the breast.  The tumor cells are negative for ER/PR and BRST-2 breast tumor antigens.  The tumor cells are also negative for Ber-Ep4 adenocarcinoma antigen  TTF-1 antigen usually occurring in adenocarcinoma of the lung and in thyroid carcinomas  negative for WT-1 antigen occurring in serous ovarian carcinoma  negative for CDX-2 and Villin antigens occurring in colorectal and some other gastrointestinal carcinomasa and negative for synaptophysin and chromograninin neuroendocrine tumor antigens. .

The second tumor focus ( 7 mm) is adenocarcinoma of mixed subtypes: bronchiolo-alveolar (90%) and acinar pattern (10%) and is present 5 cm away from the first focus in proximity of emphysematous changes.  The smallest tumor (6mm) is of papillary pattern and is present approximately 1.5 cm away from the second focus.   All three foci are morphologically different and thus considered separate synchronous primaries.A 3 mm focus of adenocarcinoma with bronchiolo-alveolar features is present at the inked surgical margin.  This focus represents also a new synchronous tumor rather than an extension of the largest focus to the margin.

The columnar cells have oval and large nuclei  small nucleoli  mild nuclear pleomorphism and some loss of nuclear polarity.  There is a fibroblastic response  patchy lymphocytic reaction and rare neutrophilic debris.  Another core biopsy shows unremarkable liver parenchyma  exhibiting normal sinusoids and bile ducts.  Neither bile stasis nor granuloma is identified.  In slide A2  there are some additional core biopsies showing abundant fibroblastic response and some scattered small mature lymphocytes.  The fibrous component shows some areas of edema or myxomatous degeneration versus mucinous pools.  Slide A3 includes a few particles of benign skeletal muscle.RESULTS OF IMMUNOPEROXIDASE STAINS:  A battery of immunoperoxidase stains was performed on block A1.  The results show that the neoplastic cells are positive with cytokeratin 7  poly-CEA and villin  and are negative with cytokeratin 20 and CDX-2.A second battery of immunoperoxidase stain results show that the neoplasm is strongly positive with the mib-1 showing an elevated nuclear positivity of nearly 100%.  The tumor is negative with calretinin  CA-125  estrogen receptor  progesterone receptor  and TTF-1 immunoperoxidase stains.  The neoplasm has an unknown primary  however  the positive CEA helps to support the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma  and the negative calretinin and WT-1 suggest that this is not mesothelioma.  The negative ER/PR do not necessarily exclude a breast primary and the negative TTF-1 (pulmonary marker) does not necessarily exclude a lung primary.  The ovarian marker  CA-125  is negative.  Clinical correlation is necessary to determine the primary neoplasm.

Positive for cytologically malignant cells  consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (see comment).COMMENT:  The results of the immunoperoxidase stains support the diagnosis of carcinoma based on the positive cytokeratins 7 and 20 immunoperoxidase stains.  Cytokeratins 7 and 20 are commonly positive together in transitional cell carcinoma  pancreatic carcinoma and ovarian mucinous carcinoma.Following  the processing of this cell block  the patient expired and underwent an autopsy  revealing tumor in the lung  liver  adrenal gland  kidney and intercostal space.  At this time there is no obvious neoplasm in the ovaries  pancreas or the urinary bladder.  Despite a negative TTF-1 immunoperoxidase stain result  the neoplasm may represent a lung primary; however  additional immunoperoxidase stains will be performed on autopsy material for further evaluation. Please see AP09-14 for correlation.

COMMENT:  The morphologic and immunophenotypic pattern is not clearly indicative of a primary tumor but is not incompatible with lung primary.  The patient's previous lung biopsy (SV-08-21152) is reviewed presently.  The previous biopsy exhibits a different morphologic and immunophenotypic pattern than what is seen in the current specimen.  The previous biopsy exhibits morphologic features of small cell carcinoma that strongly expresses the neuroendocrine marker synaptophysin and is additionally TTF-1 positive  which is different than the current chest wall mass.This case was reviewed at the Daily Intradepartmental QA Conference.  The findings were discussed with Dr. Ali Khaki on 06/18/09.A small panel of additional immunostains will be performed and the results reported in an addendum.

The tumor is aggregated into nests with central necrosis and are composed of hyperchromatic cells with minimal eosinophilic cytoplasm.  In some areas  the cytoplasm is clear.  Immunohistochemical studies show the tumor to be extensively positive for CK5/6  and only focally positive for p63  CK7  and CK20.  It is also focally positive for CDX-2 and positive for p16.  It is negative for vimentin  WT-1  HepPar-1  TTF-1  chromogranin  synaptophysin  BRST-2  and ER.  This immunoprofile tends to exclude hepatocellular carcinoma  neuroendocrine carcinoma  and metastatic breast and lung adenocarcinoma  as well as serous carcinoma of the ovary.

There is abortive gland formation as well as single cell infiltration.  There is mucin production and the cells show pleomorphic hyperchromatic  enlarged nuclei.  The glands are angulated and cribriformed in architecture occasionally.  Areas of necrosis are also present.  Immunohistochemical studies show the tumor to be diffusely positive for cytokeratin 7 and cytokeratin 19.  It is only focally positive for cytokeratin 20.  It is negative for CDX2  TTF-1  and PSA.

The tumor cells show malignant nuclear and cytoplasmic pleomorphism with moderate to abundant amounts of non-vacuolated  non-keratinized amphophilic cytoplasm having well-defined borders and relatively large  irregularly rounded or angulated  hyperchromatic nuclei frequently containing one or more prominent nucleoli and occasional cytoplasmic intranuclear pseudo inclusions.  There are moderate numbers of atypical mitoses.  The tumor cells are discohesive or form loosely cohesive groups of cells showing no tubuloglandular differentiation.  Section A2 contains an additional small piece of striated muscle and a small piece of lymphoid tissue showing extensive replacement by tumor. The tumor cells show positive immunostaining for cytokeratins AE1/AE3  cam 5.2 and CK7.  They also show focal weak immunostaining for cytokeratins 5/6 occurring in squamous and urothelial carcinomas and CK20 occurring in colorectal carcinoma or in some lung  pancreatic and urothelial carcinomas.  The tumor cells are negative for TTF-1 antigen occurring in about two-thirds of poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinomas of the lung.  They also show negative immunostaining for BerEP-4 adenocarcinoma antigen  negative immunostaining for melan-A melanoma antigen  negative immunostaining for CD56 and synaptophysin neuroendocrine tumor antigens and negative immunostaining for CD45 and CD30 antigens occurring in anaplastic large cell lymphomas.  The tumor cells have a high Ki-67 nuclear proliferation index ranging up to about 40%.

Poorly differentiated carcinoma (see microscopic description and comment).  COMMENT:  The case is discussed with the clinician  Dr. Ivan Law.  Dr. Law states that the patient has diffuse adenopathy involving the hilar  mediastinal and retroperitoneal regions.  The current specimen is from a retroperitoneal lymph node.  Dr. Law states that the patient apparently had a prior diagnosis in December  2008 at Good Samaritan Hospital which was interpreted to represent poorly differentiated carcinoma. The patient's clinical findings are reviewed on Physician Portal. A PET scan report of May 20  2009 describes increased uptake in the lymph node regions described above as well as in supraclavicular lymph nodes and multiple lesions in the spleen.The immunohistochemical profile is not specific. The lesion is a poorly differentiated carcinoma based on positive staining for AE1/AE3 and cytokeratin 7 and absence of staining for melanoma associated markers (S100 and Melan-A) and lymphoid associated marker (CD45). BerEP4  a marker associated with many adenocarcinomas  is negative here and evidence of specific differentiation is not seen on H&E stains. The carcinoma is cytokeratin 7 positive and cytokeratin 20 negative; this profile can be seen with carcinomas of lung  breast  upper GI and gynecologic primary origins. No evidence of a primary lesion is described in any of these sites on the PET scan. The lack of staining for estrogen receptor  BRST-2 and mammaglobin would argue against a breast primary. The negative estrogen receptor would also argue against a gynecologic primary and the negative WT-1 would argue specifically against a serous gynecologic tumor. CD56 and synaptophysin are negative  which would argue against a neuroendocrine carcinoma. TTF-1 is negative  which would argue against a lung adenocarcinoma primary. Cytokeratin 5/6 is negative and p63 is focally positive; squamous carcinomas  of lung or upper GI origin  while expressing p63  are typically positive for cytokeratin 5/6 as well. Villin is negative  which does not by itself exclude the possibility of an upper GI primary  including pancreaticobiliary origin  and a minority of these carcinomas can show some expression for p63.In this setting with positive hilar  mediastinal  supraclavicular and retroperitoneal lymph nodes as well as spleen  origin from lung and upper GI primary sources  including panceaticobiliary origin  should be considered; however  the immunohistochemical profile is not definitive and lesions are not described clinically in these regions. Therefore  correlation with clinical and radiologic information would be required to determine if a primary lung or upper GI source  including pancreaticobiliary origin  is present or whether another primary source can be identified.

Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (see microscopic description and comment).  COMMENT:  Review of the patient's clinical information on Physician Portal reveals an abdominal ultrasound report of May 19  2009 which describes multiple lesions within the liver as well as a lesion in the uncinate process of the pancreas and a lesion in the right kidney.  The findings of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with positive cytokeratin-7 expression and absence of cytokeratin-20 expression can be seen with adenocarcinomas of lung  breast  gynecologic and upper GI primary sources  including pancreaticobiliary origin.  The cytokeratin-7 positive/ cytokeratin-20 negative profile would argue against a renal primary source and this same profile  as well as the negative Heppar stain  would argue against hepatocellular carcinoma.  The lack of staining for estrogen receptor and brst-2 would argue against a breast primary source.  The absence of staining for estrogen receptor would also argue against a gynecologic primary source.  The absence of TTF-1 would argue against a lung primary source.  The histologic findings and immunohistochemical profile would favor a primary cholangiocarcinoma  although metastasis from an upper gastrointestinal source  including pancreas  would need to be considered  since immunohistochemical markers do not reliably distinguish carcinomas of biliary tract origin from upper GI and pancreatic origin.  Clinical correlation would therefore be required in this regard.  CONSULTATION:  Xiaohong Cai  M.D.  Ph.D.  Gastrointestinal Pathologist

The performed immunohistochemical stains demonstrate that the neoplastic elements are positive with cytokeratin 7  negative for cytokeratin 20 and CK5/6  and show focal weak positivity with p63.  Stains for TTF-1  cdx-2 and ER are negative.  In summary  although these findings are diagnostic of involvement by adenocarcinoma  the immunophenotypical findings are nonspecific and fail to definitively distinguish between a lung primary or a secondary metastatic involvement.  Correlation with the clinical findings is therefore recommended.  Case seen in consultation with Dr. Sanaa Hussain  who concurs with this interpretation.

Focal metastatic adenocarcinoma  favor lung primary (see comment) COMMENT:  Sections shows scattered small clusters of neoplastic glands within the hypocellular bone marrow with focal dense fibrosis. The neoplastic cells are large in size with oval to irregular nuclear contours  fine chromatin  inconspicuous nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. No mucin production is found.The subsequent immunostains show the neoplastic glands to be positive for pankeratin  keratin 7 and CEA-m  but negative for TTF-1  keratin 20  BRST-2  mammoglobin  ER and renal cell carcinoma markers.  The negativity of keratin 20 essentially rules out the possibility of metastatic colorectal carcinoma.  The negativity of BRST-2  mammoglobin and ER argues against the possibility of metastatic breast carcinoma.  The negativity of RCC does not support metastatic renal cell carcinoma.  Given the clinical presentation of lung mass  the overall morphologic and immunophenotypical findings are most suggestive of metastatic adenocarcinoma of pulmonary primary  despite the fact that the immunostain for TTF-1 is negative in this case.  Clinical and radiographic correlation is recommended for complete interpretation.

Poorly differentiated metastatic adenocarcinoma with focal mucinous differentiation (see comment  microscopic description and immunohistochemistry). COMMENT:  The morphologic findings are those of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with focal mucinous differentiation.  The subsequent immunostains show the neoplastic cells to be positive for keratin 7  but negative for TTF-1  keratin 20  cdx-2 and BRST-2.  The immunostain pattern rules out the possibility of metastatic adenocarcinoma from colorectal and breast origin  but fails to rule out the possibility of adenocarcinoma of lung primary due to the fact that about 25% of pulmonary adenocarcinoma is negative for TTF-1.  In addition  the possibility of metastatic adenocarcinoma from upper GI and a primary mediastinal adenocarcinoma are still in the differentiation.  Therefore  clinical and radiographic correlation is necessary for complete interpretation.Intradepartmental consultation was performed by Dr. Sanaa Hussain  Pulmonary Pathologist   who concurs with the diagnosis.The diagnosis was discussed with Dr. Daniel Loube at approximately 3:00 pm on April 20  2009.

All three are infiltrated by nests and cords of poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma with squamoid differentiation  but without glandular differentiation.  The neoplastic cells are large in size  with oval to irregular nuclear contours  fine chromatin  prominent nucleoli and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No keratinization is found.  The subsequent immunostains show the neoplastic cells to be positive for keratin AE1/AE3 and keratin 7  but negative for keratin 20  TTF-1  CEA-m  cdx-2  calretinin and PSA.  The negativity of keratin 20 and cdx-2 essentially rules out the possibility of metastatic carcinoma from colorectal origin.  The negativity of calretinin rules out the possibility of mesothelioma.  The negativity of PSA rules out the possibility of metastatic  poorly differentiated prostatic adenocarcinoma.  The overall morphologic findings are most consistent with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of lung primary.

No prostatic glandular neoplasia is identified.B)  PROSTATE (TURP):  Sections B1 through B33 contain multiple chips of prostatic and bladder neck tissue.  The prostatic tissues have generally increased fibromuscular stroma and groups of hyperplastic glands with numerous interspersed atrophic glands frequently showing cystic dilatation.  There are small scattered areas of chronic inflammation.  No high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or  prostatic carcinoma is identified in the prostatic tissues  but sections B7  B8 and B29 contain pieces of bladder muscularis and submucosa showing variably extensive infiltration by discohesive  atypical   intermediate to large-size  irregularly rounded or polygonal cells with moderate to abundant amounts of amphophilic cytoplasm having well-defined cytoplasmic borders.  A small proportion of these cells contain one or more cytoplasmic vacuoles which do not displace or mold the cell nuclei.  The nuclei are irregularly rounded or ovoid with evenly dispersed chromatin and indistinct or small nucleoli.  Mitoses are rare but the cells show a high Ki-67 nuclear proliferation index of 30-40%.The tumor cells show positive immunostaining for cytokeratin Cam 5.2  cytokeratins AE1/AE3 and cytokeratin 7 found in many epithelial tumors.  The cells are negative for cytokeratins 5/6 and p63 antigen usually occurring bladder urothelial carcinoma and squamous carcinoma.  The cells are negative for Ber Ep-4 adenocarcinoma antigen and are negative for PSA  PSAP and racemase (p504s) antigens frequently present in prostatic adenocarcinoma.  The cells are negative for cdx-2 antigen occurring in nearly all colorectal carcinomas and for TTF-1 antigen occurring in most non-small cell carcinomas of the lung.  The cells show negative immunostaining for melan-A  S-100 protein and HMB-45 melanoma antigens.  They are negative for synaptophysin frequently present in neuroendocrine cell tumors and negative for CD45  CD20 and CD3 antigens occurring in lymphomas.  The cells are negative for CD30 and AFP antigens occurring in embryonal and yolk sac tumors of the testis  but  show focal weak immunostaining for PLAP antigen occurring in seminomas  which are negative for cytokeratins AE!/AE3 and CK7.  The immunophenotype of the tumor cells is consistent with an epithelial neoplasm  but is otherwise nonspecific.

A few mitoses are noted.  The cells show no evident cytoplasmic keratinization or tubuloglandular arrangements.  Section A2 contains small fragments of tumor intermixed with relatively large amounts of blood clot.  The tumor cells form predominantly solid trabecular arrangements and have a somewhat squamous appearance  but show no cytoplasmic keratinization.  Moderate numbers of mitoses are noted.  The atypical cells show positive immunostaining for cytokeratins AE1/AE3  but are negative for cytokeratins 7 and 20 and TTF-1 antigens   which favors poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma over adenocarcinoma.  The atypical cells are aso negative for synaptophysin neuroendocrine tumor antigen. (FDC)B)  RETROPERITONEAL MASS:  Sections demonstrate three cores of lymphoid tissue; two of them are diffusely infiltrated by sheets of intermediate to large atypical lymphoid cells intermixed with scattered small mature T cells with a focal vaguely nodular pattern  and one core shows a predominantly nodular pattern with fibrosis.  The majority of neoplastic cells have a monocytoid appearance with clear cytoplasm  but the nuclei are more irregularly in shape and larger in size than those of  conventional monocytoid B cells normally seen in marginal zone lymphoma.  In addition  many neoplastic cells show fine chromatin and prominent nucleoli with active mitoses and focal increased endothelial vascularity.  The appearance is that of diffuse high grade B cell lymphoma.  The subsequent immunostains show the lymphoma cells to be strongly positive for CD20 with follicular lymphoma phenotypic features (positive for CD10  bcl-6 and bcl-2)  and  with a markedly increased Ki-67 proliferative rate (approximately 80%).  No CD20/CD43 coexpression is found. The stains for CD5 and cyclin-D1 are negative in lymphoma cells  ruling out the possibility of blastoid mantle cell lymphoma.  The stains for CD21 and CD23 highlight the distorted or expanded follicular dendritic meshwork.  The stain for CD3 highlights scattered small reactive T cells and focal interfollicular T cell aggregates.The overall morphologic and immunophenotypical findings support a diagnosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma  possibly arising from follicular lymphoma.

Assessment of size is difficult due to  the fragmentation of the tissue  with the size of 2.8 cm being an estimate based on the number of positive submitted tissue blocks having significant tumor involvement (7 positive blocks x 0.4 cm of block thickness = 2.8 cm).  The assessment of the margin  is made difficult by the presence of numerous detached tumor fragments. No definitive evidence of involvement of the vascular and bronchial margin of resection is however apparent.  Note is made of the presence of tumor clusters involving the visceral pleura (section D6)  a findings also demonstrated by a stain for elastin.  The performed immunohistochemical stains are compatible with the above interpretation  demonstrating the positivity of the neoplastic tumor cells for CK7  focal weak positivity for CK 5/6  focal expression of mucicarmine and absence of significant positivity for p63.  Minor focal weak positivity for TTF-1 is also identified.  A stain for CK20 appears to be negative in the neoplastic elements.CONSULTATION:  The case is seen in consultation with Sidney H.

Invasive  small cell  undifferentiated  neuroendocrine carcinoma/neoplasm (see comment).COMMENT:  At this time the results of immunoperoxidase stains support the diagnosis of small cell undifferentiated neuroendocrine neoplasm with a high proliferative rate; (mib-1 is nearly 100% in the neoplastic cells).  CD56 and synaptophysin are positive  indicative of a neuroendocrine neoplasm.As discussed with Dr. Menashe on Friday 03-13-09  at approximately 3:30 pm  this patient has a prior history of prostatic carcinoma (approximately fifteen years ago)  the subtype of which is unknown at this time.  Although this does not look like a typical prostatic adenocarcinoma  a prostatic neuroendocrine neoplasm has not been ruled out at this time.  From the current markers  the TTF-1 (pulmonary marker) is negative  suggesting that this is not metastatic from a lung primary.  Clinical correlation  as always  is required.Meanwhile  a second battery of immunoperoxidase stains is pending for further evaluation  and a final report will follow intramural consultation.

The two tumor foci are separated by a 5.5 cm area of normal lung parenchyma  are  histologically different.  Therefore they will be considered two synchronous tumors and will be staged accordingly.  The submitted specimen was received with two stapled lines of which one was previously marked by the surgeon as true parenchymal margin.  The submitted sections from this stapled line is negative for invasive carcinoma.  However  the second stapled line which was not marked as true parenchymal margin is positive for papillary adenocarcinoma and is grossly abut the second smaller tumor focus (2.5cm).These findings were discussed with Dr. Handy at 1:20 pm on 3/10/2009.

Poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma with ulceration  consistent with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of esophageal primary (see comment).COMMENT:  The patient's previous right upper lobectomy specimen (SP-06-21301) was reviewed concurrently and contributes to the above interpretation.  The poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma noted in the previously specimen is morphologically different from the current poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma in the esophagus.  Additional immunostains were performed on the previous pulmonary adenocarcinoma and show the tumor cells to be positive for keratin 7 and TTF-1  but negative for keratin 20 and p63.  In contrast  the immunostains show the current esophageal poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma to be positive for p63  but negative for keratin 7 and TTF-1.  The different immunostaining patterns between these two tumors further supports that they are two different primary tumors rather than a primary lung tumor with late esophageal metastasis.  In review of the patient's history in Physician Portal  the patient also presented with a mediastinal mass which involved the esophagus.  As this esophageal carcinoma is poorly differentiated  the possibility of a poorly differentiated metastatic thymic carcinoma or metastatic poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma from other sites  such as head and neck   cannot be entirely excluded by histologic examination alone.  Therefore  clinical and radiographic correlation is necessary for complete interpretation.Intradepartmental consultation was performed by Dr. Sidney Rosenheim  who concurs with the diagnosis.The diagnosis was discussed with Dr. Alan Savoy at approximately 3:30 pm on 02/18/2009.

Moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.COMMENT:  This right lower lobe biopsy is compared to a previous liver biopsy  SP09-2055.  Morphologically  these tumors are different with that in the liver being poorly differentiated and composed of large pleomorphic cells with dense cytoplasm and variably prominent nucleoli.  The mass in the lung is composed of tall cells with more vesicular chromatin  less conspicuous nucleoli  and well defined papillary architecture.  Immunophenotypically  these tumors differ in that the tumor in the lung is strongly positive for cytokeratin 20 (repeated)  while that in the liver is negative.  Furthermore  the neoplasm in the lung is focally positive for BerEP4  while that in the liver is negative.  That having been said  the immunophenotype of the lung tumor is not totally typical of primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma in that typically lung cancers are negative for cytokeratin 20 and positive for TTF-1.  (Approximately 10% of lung cancers are positive for CK20).  The exact opposite pertains to this neoplasm.The chest CT suggests that this is a large (4 cm) mass in the right lower lobe with morphology suggestive of a primary lung neoplasm.  The abdominal CT demonstrated only the liver metastasis  but the pancreas and other abdominal organs were found to be negative.A PET CT might be useful in identifying other possible primary sites.  In conclusion  we are confronted with two neoplasms with different morphologies and immunophenotypes  and furthermore  the neoplasm in the lung is not textbook typical of that organ.  Further clinical correlation will be required.A concurring second opinion has been rendered by Yaping Wu  M.D.

Large vessels are also noted and are negative for neoplastic involvement.  The shorter staple line on A4 is also negative for neoplasm.  A5 and A6 demonstrate the intermediate size staple line and these sections demonstrate bronchi and vasculature  as well as pulmonary parenchyma.  No neoplasm is evident on these sections.  Visceral pleura is included.  The large mass is included on slides A7 through A9.  This is a poorly differentiated carcinoma with clear cell features.  The tumor grows as irregular nests in a sclerotic stroma.  The malignant epithelial cells are characterized by irregular ovoid nuclei with coarse nuclear chromatin and small nucleoli.  Abundant clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm is present.  The neoplasm is present in a dense fibroblastic stroma.  Tumor is present immediately beneath the visceral pleura which is retracted by the neoplasm.  The tumor also surrounds regional blood vessels.Slide A10 demonstrates lung tissue with adherent parietal pleura.  Subpleural blebs are present with emphysematous change and chronic inflammation.  There is bronchiolar metaplasia of the cyst walls. Blocks A8 and A9 are stained with a panel of monoclonal antibodies to further subclassify the neoplasm.  The tumor is found to strongly express cytokeratin 7 while it is negative for keratin 5/6  which does stain some of the benign metaplastic epithelium.  p63 is variably positive.  BerEP-4  which is an adenocarcinoma marker  is negative but polyclonal CEA is strongly positive.  Mucicarmine stains are negative.  The neuroendocrine markers CD56 and synaptophysin are negative.  Lymphatic vascular invasion can be demonstrated with immunostains for D2-40.

Some of the marrow has reactive fibrosis.  Embedded in this  there are some very rare atypical clusters of large cells with mildly pleomorphic nuclei  distorted frayed cytoplasm and increased N:C ratios.  These cells have small nucleoli and show no evidence of glandular formation or intercellular bridges.  There is no intracytoplasmic pigment.  One of the clusters has a vague pseudogland contour.  The cytoplasm is pink and ill-defined.  In slide A2  there are additional minute cellular clusters composed of atypical large cells with hyperchromatic oval enlarged nuclei and ill-defined pink cytoplasm.  These are associated with reactive bone.  The irregular jagged bony trabeculae have viable osteocytes and occasional mosaic lines.  B)  CERVICAL SPINAL TUMOR:  Additional particles of viable bone and cartilaginous tissue show some areas of reactive bone  fibroblastic marrow and some rare epithelial cells  one forming a splayed gland  consistent with an adenocarcinoma.  The nuclei are hyperchromatic and mildly to moderately enlarged.  Cytoplasm is cuboidal and ill-defined pink.  At least one complex gland is apparent and splayed open in a larger fragment.  A battery of immunoperoxidase stains is performed on block B1.  The results show that the neoplastic glands are positive with TTF-1 (pulmonary marker)  polyclonal CEA  cytokeratin 7  and cytokeratin 20.  The tumor is negative with villin  BerEP4  and cdx-2 immunoperoxidase stains.  Given the positive TTF-1 result  a pulmonary primary is favored  despite the fact that most lung primaries are positive for cytokeratin 7 and negative for cytokeratin 20.  Other adenocarcinomas which may be positive for cytokeratin 7 and cytokeratin 20 would include pancreatic carcinoma  however  as mentioned  a positive TTF-1 would favor a pulmonary primary instead.

Clusters of malignant tumor cells are seen diffusely present on the material with cells having pleomorphic nuclei  prominent nucleoli and irregular nuclear margins.  Cytoplasmic vacuolization is seen.  Cell in cell arrangement is present.  The tumor cells are associated with a lymphocytic cell population  as well as scattered reactive-appearing mesothelial cells.  Immunohistochemical stains show strong immunoreactivity for cytokeratin 7.  Calretinin stains show positivity within the surrounding mesothelial cells  however  the tumor cells are negative.  The tumor cells are also immunonegative for TTF-1 and cytokeratin 20.  Although most lung adenocarcinomas do show TTF-1 immunoreactivity  there is a small percentage that is nonresponsive to this antigen.  A lung adenocarcinoma is favored.

An included parabronchial lymph node shows anthracosis  but is negative for metastatic disease.  The vascular margin on B2 is found to be negative for neoplasm.  B3 through B5 demonstrate the staple line and these sections all demonstrate benign lung tissue with some included visceral pleura.  Subpleural fibrosis and aggregates of lymphocytes are noted.  Focal reactive changes are noted in the visceral pleura which is somewhat thickened.  Avulsed visceral pleura is noted on slide B6  but again there is no neoplasm present. The included lung tissue is well aerated and shows no active inflammation. B7 through B10 demonstrate the mass.  This is an infiltrating  moderately differentiated pulmonary adenocarcinoma characterized by neoplastic glands that are present in a reactive fibrous stroma.  The malignant glands are composed of epithelial cells with large pleomorphic nuclei.  These display coarse chromatin  irregular nuclear membranes  and prominent nucleoli.  Abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm is present.  Tumor is noted surrounding pulmonary arteries and bronchi.  Foci of vascular invasion are not identified.  In many fields  there is a rather abrupt transition between neoplasm and aerated lung  but in some fields there is a lepidic growth pattern with malignant cells streaming out along the native alveolar septa.  Slide B11 demonstrates irregular fibrous adhesions  but these are uninvolved by neoplasm.

Only rare mitotic figures are identified.  The performed immunohistochemical stains demonstrate that the neoplastic elements are positive for Cam 5.2  PSA  racemase  and show focal positivity for PSAP.  Stains for neuroendocrine markers (CD56  synaptophysin  chromogranin) and stains for bcl-2  Villin  CDX-2  keratin 7 and keratin 20 are negative.  The presence of minimal weak and focal  positivity for TTF-1  a finding in this context of unclear significance  is noted.   The proliferative index  estimated by a stain for ki-67  is low.  In summary  these findings are consistent  in particular in view of the strong positivity for PSA  with involvement by a metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma despite the unusual neuroendocrine-like morphological pattern of growth of the neoplasm.

Metastatic  poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma  favor lung primary (see comment).COMMENT:  Sections demonstrate three cores of liver tissue; one of them is diffusely infiltrated by sheets of poorly differentiated carcinoma with focal glandular differentiation.  The neoplastic cells are large with oval to irregular nuclear contours  central prominent nucleoli and moderate to abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Mitoses are easily found.  No mucin production or squamoid differentiation is found.  By histology  the differential diagnosis includes metastatic  poorly differentiated carcinoma or poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma.The subsequent immunostains show the neoplastic cells to be positive for keratin 7  but negative for keratin 20  CDx-2  villin  TTF-1  PSA and hepatocyte marker.  The negativity of the hepatocyte marker essentially rules out the possibility of hepatocellular carcinoma.  The negativity of keratin 20  CDx-2 and villin is not consistent with the immunophenotype of metastatic carcinoma of colorectal origin.  The negative of the PSA rules out the possibility of metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma.  The negativity of TTF-1 neither supports nor completely excludes the possibility of a metastatic pulmonary carcinoma.  While the morphologic findings and the positivity of keratin 7 are most consistent with pulmonary primary  the remote possibility of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma cannot be entirely excluded by histology and immunohistochemical studies alone.  Therefore  clinical and radiographic correlation is needed for complete interpretation.Intradepartmental consultation was performed by Dr. Sidney Rosenheim  who concurs with the diagnosis.

Histologically  the metastatic adenocarcinoma is similar to the poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma noted in the previous left lower lobe resection specimen (SP-06-13707).  To confirm the diagnosis and to rule out the remote possibility of metastatic tumor from another region  a panel of immunohistochemical studies was performed and shows the metastatic adenocarcinoma to be positive for keratin 7 and TTF-1  but negative for keratin 20 and cdx-2. The result confirms the morphologic impression of metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinoma.  Clinical and radiographic correlation is recommended for complete interpretation.

The malignant cells vaguely form acinar structures.  These cells are characterized by hyperchromatic nuclei with irregular nuclear contours.  Immunohistochemical stains are performed and evaluated.  The tumor cells are positive for TTF-1 and weakly CK-7  which favor a lung primary. The tumor cells are positive for monoclonal CEA which supports an adenocarcinoma.  The tumor is negative for CK-20 and CDX-2  which argues against a GI primary. The tumor is negative for PSA  which argues against a prostate primary.
